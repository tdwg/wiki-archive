The following is based on the information contained in the UBIF schema (UBIF_EnumLib.xsd). Please note, that substantial discussion material (questions, terms assumed synonymous, rejected terms) is separately available at NomenclaturalTypeStatusOfSpecimensDiscussion.  

See also comments on the taxon concept transfer schema: http://www.soc.napier.ac.uk/tdwg/index.php?pagename=TypeStatusEnumeration.

See [[http://wiki.cs.umb.edu/twiki/pub/UBIF/EnumeratedValues/UBIF-Docu-Enumerations.html#NomenclaturalTypeStatusOfUnitsEnum][UBIF enumeration info]] for a tabular overview of values.

---
<p>This list is a first version of a constrained vocabulary to express typifying relations between taxonomic names and units (specimens or objects preserved in collections). Beyond those type categories explicitly governed by nomenclatural codes (Zoology, Botany, Bacterioloy, Virology), the list also includes some additional type status terms. These categories may be helpful when interpreting the original circumscription (topotypes, ex-types), but do not have the same binding status as terms governed by the nomenclatural codes. The enumeration attempts to strike a balance between listing all possible terms, and remaining comprehensible. In general, including too many terms was considered less problematic than omitting terms. Applications may easily select a subset for presentation in their user interface.</p>

<p>This list is intended as a first version and it is hoped that in the review process through TDWG it will achieve sufficient maturity to be truly useful. It is expected that over time revisions will have to be made. Please use the WIKI (http://wiki.cs.umb.edu/twiki/bin/view/UBIF/NomenclaturalTypeStatusOfSpecimensDiscussion) to discuss the current list and the lists of synonymous, doubtful, or excluded type terms provided therein.</p>

<p>Some background information: A type provides the objective standard of reference to determine the application of a taxon name. The type status of a unit (specimen) is only meaningful in combination with the name that is being typified (a unit may have been designated type for multiple names in different publications). The type status of an object may be designated in the original description of a scientific name (original designation), or - under rules layed out in the respective nomenclatural codes - at a later time (subsequent designation). -- For taxa above species rank the type is always a lower rank taxon (e. g., species for genus, genus for family). The type terms for this situation are not included in the enumeration. Ultimately, typication of all taxa goes back to physical type units, but this should not be recorded as such in data sets. The indirect type reference in higher taxa means that typification changes to the lower taxon automatically affect the higher taxon.</p>

<p>The exact definitions of type status differ between nomenclatural codes (ICBN, ICZN, ICNP/ICNB, etc.). The term definitions are intended to be informative and generally applicable across the different codes. The should not be interpreted as authoritative; in nomenclatural work the exact definitions in the respective codes have to be consulted. A duplication of status codes (bot-holo, zoo-holo, bact-holo, etc.) is not considered desirable or necessary. Since the application of the type status terms is constrained by the relationship of the typified name with a specific code, the exact definition can always be unambiguously retrieved.</p>

<p>The following publications have been consulted to determine the number of type terms that should be included and to prepare the semantic definitions:</p><ul>
<li>Nomenclatural Glossary for Zoology (January 18 2000; ftp://ftp.york.biosis.org/sysgloss.txt; verified 17. June 2004)</li>
<li>ICBN St. Louis Code (http://www.bgbm.fu-berlin.de/iapt/nomenclature/code/SaintLouis/0013Ch2Sec2a009.htm; verified 17. June 2004)</li>
<li>Draft <nop>BioCode 4th version (Greuter et al., 1997; http://www.rom.on.ca/biodiversity/biocode/biocode1997.html)</li>
<li>Glossary of 'type' terminology (Ronald H. Petersen; http://fp.bio.utk.edu/mycology/Nomenclature/nom-type.htm)</li>
<li>Dictionary of Ichthyology (Brian W. Coad and Don E. <nop>McAllister, 2004; http://www.briancoad.com/Dictionary/introduction.htm)</li>
<li>A useful resource that was not available when writing this proposal might be: Hawksworth, D.L., W.G. Chaloner, O. Krauss, J. <nop>McNeill, M.A. Mayo, D.H. Nicolson, P.H.A. Sneath, R.P. Trehane and P.K. Tubbs. 1994. A draft Glossary of terms used in Bionomenclature. (IUBS Monogr. 9) International Union of Biological Sciences, Paris. 74 pp. </li></ul>

A hapantotype, while a series of individuals, is a holotype that must not be restricted by lectotype selection. If a hapantotype is found to contain individuals of more than one species, however, components may be excluded until it contains individuals of only one species [ICZN Article 73.3.2]. [Zoo.]</td></tr><tr class="data1"><td>holo</td><td>Holotype</td><td/><td>The one specimen or other element used or designated by the original author at the time of publication of the original description as the nomenclatural type of a species or infraspecific taxon. A holotype may be 'explicit' if it is clearly stated in the originating publication or 'implicit' if it is the single specimen proved to have been in the hands of the originating author when the description was published.

Lectotype designation can occur only where no holotype was designated at the time of publication or if it is missing (ICBN Art. 7, ICZN Art. 74).
