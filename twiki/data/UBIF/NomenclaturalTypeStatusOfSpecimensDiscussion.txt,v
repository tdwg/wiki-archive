<h3>Open issues</h3>
	* Should iconotype be reserved for those illustrations that actually substitute a holotype? Then we need an additional term for drawings, photographs a) in the original publication, b) in other publications (plesiotypes)
	* One database also had: "MENT Mentioned or measured specimen"
	* "Secondary type" / "Supplementary type": currently only summary terms are proposed! I believe the term plesiotype is probably not helpful in the enumeration, since it would apply to ALL specimens identified to a name, except those with a different type status: <br />"plesio Plesiotype -- A specimen identified by a subsequent author as belonging to a particular species. [Zoo.]"
	* But perhaps specific terms from the plesiotype group should be added? Hypotype (which may be same as plesiotype??), Homotype, Autotype, Metatype?
	* Neotypes may be superseded under certain conditions, see e. g. ICBN Art. 9.13 [W. Gams]
	* Isosyntype is defined as "A duplicate of a syntype, compare isotype = duplicate of holotype" Gregor Hagedorn: Is this questionable? I personally don't understand it - but it is used in ICBN 9.10!

---

<h3>Additional type terms</h3>
<p>These terms are not included in the enumeration. They are sorted into five categories:</p>

<p><strong>1. Terms considered synonyms of enumerated terms</strong> ###Please review, is this acceptable?###</p>
	* Alloparatype: use Allotype.
	* Alloplesiotype: use Plesiotype. The additional information about sex should be negligible in the case of plesiotypes.
	* Antitype: use Paratype.
	* Cotype: generally use Syntype, but the term may have been used erroneously (see below).
	* Figure type (or "figured specimen"): use Iconotype
	* Hololectotype: use Lectotype
	* Holoneotype: use Neotype 
	* Holoparalectotype : use Paralectotype 
	* Holoparatype: use Paratype (also used to designate a paratype of the same sex as the holotype)
	* Holoplesiotype: use Plesiotype (also used to designate a plesiotype of the same sex as the holotype)
	* Lectoparatype: use Paralectotype 
	* Locotype: use Topotype 
	* Neoholotype: use Neotype 
	* Neallotype: use Neotype. The additional information about sex should be retrievable separately.
	* Neoparatype: use Paraneotype 
	* Phototype: use Iconotype

<p><strong>2. Terms relating to typifications of one name based on another name.</strong> (These may have to be added to a separate enumeration, but currently no need has been established for such an enumeration.)</p>
	* Autogenotype: A genotype by original designation.
	* Apogenotype: The type-species of a genus renamed to avoid homonymy (??).
	* Generitype (= "genotype", no longer used because of confusion): type specimen of the species name typifying a genus. [Def. G. Hagedorn]
	* Generotype: Species name typifying a genus. [Def. G. Hagedorn]
	* Genoholotype: type specimen of the species name typifying a genus, designated by the original author. [Def. G. Hagedorn]
	* Genolectotype: genotype + lectotype ...
	* Genoparatype: genotype + paratype ...
	* Genoisotype: genotype + isotype ...
	* Genosyntype: genotype + syntype ...
	* Genoneotype: genotype + neotype ...
	* Logotype (obsolete term): The type-species of a genus by designation subsequent to publication. Compare Orthotype.
	* Monotype: A genus with one species or a family with one genus. In general, applied to any taxon with only one immediately subordinate taxon of one of the principal ranks. (<nop>McVaugh et al. 1968. Regn. Veget. 56: 17; ICBN). Comment: Although a nomenclatural term, the word has little to do with the typification process, but only the state of various taxa after their description, and often temporary at that. Monotype has been interpreted (Korf and Rogers. 1967. Taxon 16: 20) as an implied holotype. [Def. R. H. Petersen]
	* Diplotype: genoholotype (the primary type of the type species of the genus, designate by the author in the original description of the genus). Note G. Hagedorn: The term is superfluous if type status is considered not a single property of a specimen, but a property on a relation between a specimen and a name.
	* Orthotype (obsolete term): The type-species of a genus by original designation. Compare Logotype.
	* Synonymotype: The constituent or element of a taxon quoted by the [originating] author as being identical with his newly established taxon (Fuchs. 1958. Taxon 7: 219). Comment: Many of the early workers (before about 1850) proposed new names for taxa which were known to bear already established names (i.e. nomina superflua). Especially with pre-starting date names (or pre-sanctioning date), such names may have served as the basis for post-starting date legitimate names, and could be afforded some status. [Def. R. H. Petersen]

<p><strong>3. Terms using the word "type" in an unrelated context than the typification-by-object:</strong></p>
	* Agrotype: a group of cultivars related by morphological or other characters, sometimes cultivated together (Jirasek. Taxon 10: 38. 1961). Comment: Apparently, a more accepted term is conculta. [Def. R. H. Petersen]
	* Archetype: In phylogenetics an ancestral type established hypothetically by eliminating characters known to be derived in later taxa. [Def. G. Hagedorn]
	* Arithmotype: specimens bearing the same herbarium or collection number, not necessarily representing a single taxon (Wherry. Taxon 1: 32, 1992). Comment: A useful term, but not in connection with typification. Problems arise when several specimens are incorrectly (or "correctly") labeled as identical, but in fact differ (i.e. exsiccati collected in differing circumstances) or several small specimens (i.e. fungus fruit bodies, small grasses, mosses, etc.) under a single number in "one" collection. [Def. R. H. Petersen] -- Note: The Dictionary of Ichthyology defines quite differently: "arithmotype = an isotype, which belongs to a different taxon from the holotype" (http://www.briancoad.com/Dictionary/A.htm)
	* Bioserotype (= bioserovar): see serotype
	* Biotype (= Biovar): (not nomenclatural) genotypic race.
	* Chemotype (= chemovar or chemoform): Santesson (1968). Chemically characterized portions of morphologically indistinguishable populations. [Def. R. H. Petersen]
	* Cultotype: A rarely used rank (or strain!) designation in botany. [Def. G. Hagedorn]
	* Ecotype: (not nomenclatural). 1) a particular phenotypic or genotypic strain produced by environmental variation. Comment: The term has no connection with nomenclatural typification. 2) Jirasek (Taxon 10: 42. 1961) notes the use of this term for cultivated plants. Subsets of ecotypes are local ecotype (ecotypus localis) and regional ecotype (ecotypus regionalis, also known as geoecotype). [Def. R. H. Petersen]
	* Ecophenotype: = Ecotype/Phenotype
	* Genotype: (not nomenclatural) a genetically defined population. Also used in older zoological literature for the type specimen of type species of genus. Now "Generitype" is preferred. [Def. G. Hagedorn]
	* Geoecotype: see ecotype
	* Heterotype: a type derived by combining characters from different species (e.g. in fossils). [Def. G. Hagedorn]
	* Ideotype: "idealised commercial plant form", used in plant breeding
	* Lysotype (= lysovar.): = Phagotype
	* Morphotype (morphovar.): Morphologically distinguishable populations of a single taxon, special case of Phenotype. [Def. R. H. Petersen/G. Hagedorn]
	* Pathotype: Pathologically differentiated races of fungi or bacteria (= "pathodeme").
	* Phagotype: An infraspecific classification in bacteria based on sensibility against bacteriophages. [Def. G. Hagedorn]
	* Phenotype: (not nomenclatural) appearance of an organism. The same genotype may have different phenotypes, e. g. due to environmental factors. [Def. G. Hagedorn]
	* Physiotype: Robinson, 1969. Physiologically differentiated races of fungi ("physiodeme"). [Def. R. H. Petersen]
	* Serotype (= serovar): (not nomenclatural) infraspecific grouping distinguishable by serological characteristics (based on antibody/antigen reactions). Also: bioserotype. [Def. G. Hagedorn]
	* Sortotype: see agrotype. [Def. R. H. Petersen]
	* Logotype: "type determined from a written description in the absence of an illustration and of a specimen" (http://www.briancoad.com/Dictionary/L.htm) -- explicitly not referring to a specimen, so it can only refer to a circumscription of a taxon.

---

<p><strong>4. Type terms strongly deprecated because confusing. They may have to be added to the enumeration for backwards compatibility, please comment!</strong></p>
	* Cotype: 1) same as syntype. 2) (erroneous) any and all elements cited by the originating author in the originating publication (cf. <nop>McVaugh, et al., Regn. Veget. 56: 11. 1968). Comment: Because of the inaccuracy of the term, syntype, isotype and paratype should be used. [Def. R. H. Petersen] -- At the moment considered a synonym of Syntype, see list above [GH]

---

<p><strong>5. Questionable type terms that may have to be added to the enumeration. Please comment!</strong></p>
	* Apotype: a specimen used to supplement the description of a type.
	* Autotype: The Dictionary of Ichthyology has two distinct semantics for this: "1) the type, by original designation, of a taxon -- 2) a specimen designated by the author of a species subsequent to the original publication as being identical to the holotype." (http://www.briancoad.com/Dictionary/A.htm) (Also used in database! http://www.entomology.wisc.edu/irc/irctype.html)
	* Auxiliary Type: (Regn. Veget. 81: 10. 1972.) A specimen or element to serve as type of a subordinate taxon when the type of the major taxon is inadequate to assign subordinate rank names to that type. Also called "Sustaining specimen". [Def. R. H. Petersen]
	* Cheirotype: "a type specimen of a species designated by a manuscript name" (http://www.briancoad.com/Dictionary/C.htm)
	* Chirotype: = Cheirotype
	* Clastotype: an element originating from the same clone as the type (Wherry. Taxon 1: 32. 1952.). Comment: It would appear that Wherry obtained the term elsewhere, but its origin is not known to me. The term would seem useful also in mycology, where a single mycelium can be sampled repeatedly. [Def. R. H. Petersen]
	* collateral type: = any specimen, other than the primary type, used in a species description (http://www.briancoad.com/Dictionary/C.htm)
	* Cytotype: a portion of the type, prepared to exhibit identical cytological features (i.e. chromosomes) as those originally described for the taxon. [Def. R. H. Petersen]
	* Descriptotype: that element or elements on which the original description was based (Fuchs. 1958. Taxon 7: 219). Comment: A useful term, but not sharply enough defined. The following situations lack resolution: 1) when a holotype consists of several specimens (i.e. fungi, mosses, etc.), and only a few were used as the basis for the original description (and often these were discarded; i.e. microscope mounts used for infracellular descriptions and spore measurements). Descriptotype is more limited than holotype. 2) When a number of specimens were used as the basis for the original description (holotype, paratypes), descriptotype becomes more inclusive than holotype. [Def. R. H. Petersen]
	* deuterotype: a replacement type specimen  (http://www.briancoad.com/Dictionary/D.htm)
	* Heautotype: "A specimen figured by an author as an illustration of a species or subspecies which had previously been described as new by him. This is really only one particular kind of a plesiotype." (http://www.coleoptera.org/p890.htm)
	* Homeotype: "A specimen that has been identified by a worker who is recognized as an authority on the group of organisms to which it belongs, after the specimen has been carefully compared by, him with the original type or types of the species or subspecies to which it is referred." (http://www.coleoptera.org/p890.htm) and "A specimen which had been compared with the original type material and found to be identical" (http://www.fish.washington.edu/naturemapping/mollusks/glossary.html) and "a specimen compared with the type by an author other than the author of the species and determined as conspecific." (http://www.briancoad.com/Dictionary/H.htm) (Also used in database! http://www.entomology.wisc.edu/irc/irctype.html)
	* Homoeotype = Homeotype
	* Homotopotype: homoeotype from the type locality.
	* Homotype = Homeotype
	* Hypotype: "a specimen described and/or figured to increase knowledge of a previously described species" (http://www.briancoad.com/Dictionary/H.htm) and "Another name occasionally used is Hypotype, a described or figured specimen used in a publication to extend or correct the knowledge of a previously defined species." (http://www.anri.barc.usda.gov/bnpcu/how2dep.asp) and "Specimen or specimens of a species or subspecies re-described and figured subsequently to the original description. The term is becoming obsolete." (http://www.fish.washington.edu/naturemapping/mollusks/glossary.html)
	* Icotype: a specimen used for identification, worked on by the original author, or collected from the type locality, but not one used for the published description" (http://www.briancoad.com/Dictionary/I.htm)
	* Ideotype: "A specimen collected from some other general locality than the original type (that is, not a topotype) that has been identified by the original author of the species or subspecies to which it is referred at a date subsequent to the publication of the original description. This is like a metatype, except that it does not come from the general locality from which the original type specimens of the species or subspecies were collected." (http://www.coleoptera.org/p890.htm), "a specimen examined by the author of a species but not from the type locality" (http://www.briancoad.com/Dictionary/I.htm) -- Ideotype also used in plant breeding, quite differently!
	* Idiotype = Ideotype
	* Interpretotype: Specimens interpreted by the originating author as belonging to the same taxon as the one proposed. (Fuchs. 1958. Taxon 7: 219). Comment: As proposed, the term seems nothing more than a substitute for "authentic specimens." Note the following difficulties: 1) the possibility of misidentification by the originating author; and 2) uncited specimens merely identified by the originating author. [Def. R. H. Petersen]
	* Isogenotype: ?? (This results in a memorable Google query with nonsense-only results... :-) )
	* Kleptotype: (conventional). A portion of the type specimen purloined and resident in a collection other than that of the originating author. Comment: The term denotes nefarious motive, and has little justification in science. It is usually very difficult to ascertain under what circumstances specimens came into particular hands, especially during the long period in which specimens were shared, divided and distributed very freely by herbaria and institutions. [Def. R. H. Petersen]
	* Merotype: Portions of the holotype detached and resident away from the holotype (Fuchs. 1958. Taxon 7: 219). Comment: A useful term if used as more limited than isotype. The intent of the proposal was to designate portions of the holotype detached and distributed after the originating publication and therefore not specifically cited by the originating author. The term is most germane in regard to cryptogams, where several plants or carpophores may be included in the holotype, or in regard to particular plant organs (i.e. flowers, fruits, etc.) easily detached from the holotype. [Def. R. H. Petersen]
	* Metatype: "A topotype identified by the original describer of the species or subspecies to which it is referred, but at a date subsequent to the publication of the original description." (http://www.coleoptera.org/p890.htm) and "1) a specimen from the type locality determined by the original author subsequent to the original description of the species. - 2) a specimen subsequently determined by the author after comparison with type" (http://www.briancoad.com/Dictionary/M.htm) -- (Also used in database! http://www.entomology.wisc.edu/irc/irctype.html)
	* Morphotype: "A specimen which has been figured in print (a figured specimen), but which has not been used to illustrate anything not previously known about the morphology of the species or subspecies to which it is referred." (http://www.coleoptera.org/p890.htm)
	* Neocotype: a neo-cotype ... 
	* Neotype, established: necessary distinction in this enumeration?
	* Neotype, proposed: necessary distinction in this enumeration?
	* Onomatype "A specimen which has been cited in print (a cited specimen), but which has not been used to illustrate anything not previously known about the morphology of the species or subspecies to which it is referred." (http://www.coleoptera.org/p890.htm)
	* Orthotype: any type by original designation.
	* Phototype (conventional): 1) a photograph of the type; 2) a photograph serving as the type (ICBN, Art. 7). Comment: In recent years, classic herbaria have been photographed, and the photographs, and the photographic collections distributed. In those cases where critical taxonomic characters are visible in photographs, the system works well, but institutions which circulate ONLY photographs stand in danger of violating the spirit of the scientific community, even though justified in their action by the ICBN (... "scrupulously conserved"...). The International Documentation Center has made available phototypes on microfiche. [Def. R. H. Petersen]
	* Phycotype: In lichens, a combination of one mycobiont with different photobiontic algae [Def. G. Hagedorn]
	* Pragmatype: ??
	* Prostype: ??
	* Prototype (= Protype): ??
	* Pseudotype: (Sreemadhaven. 1968. Taxon 17: 586). Any duplicate of the holotype, syntype or paratype that was NOT studied by the originating author up to the time the name of the taxon was published. [Def. R. H. Petersen]
	* Schizotype: (Korf and Rogers. 1967. Taxon 16: 22) The one specimen or other element from the original material retained in a taxon by an author who has treated in a single publication all of the syntypes of a taxon and has specifically excluded from the taxon each of the other eligible syntypes. Comment: Proposed as a special kind of implied lectotype, the term, while useful, inflicts additional literature review beyond the originating publication and other well-known works. The examples cited are all from the fungi. [Def. R. H. Petersen] -- "schizotype = a syntype regarded by a subsequent author as the type of a taxon but not specifically designated as the type for that taxon" (http://www.briancoad.com/Dictionary/S.htm)"
	* Symbiotype: host specimen from which a new symbiotic or parasitic taxon was described (=symbiotype specimen; see Frey, J.K., T.L. Yates, D.W. Duszynski, W.L. Gannon and S.L. Gardner. 1992. Designation and curatorial management of type host specimens (symbiotypes) for new parasite species. Journal of Parasitology 78: 930-932.) [Def. G. Hagedorn]
	* Typotype: When a description or illustration serves as a type, the specimen(s) on which the description and/or illustration was based can be termed the typotype (Taxon 13: 113. 1964). [Def. R. H. Petersen]
	* Typus conservandus: Latin, "a type to be conserved;" abbreviated typ. cons. (<nop>McVaugh et al. 1968. Regn. Veget. 56: 26). Comment: Homonyms usually are separated taxonomically based on their types. Thus, in such cases, among others, it may be exigent to conserve a type and thus the concept of the name. [Def. R. H. Petersen]. Note W. Gams: Most important case is ICBN Art. 14.3, where the application of a taxon may be conserved through a changed type (e. g. Rhizoctonia DC. 1805 typified by R. solani Kühn of later date than the original type).
	* Xerotypus/xerotype: (not found by Google!)

	* Phagotype: An infraspecific classification in bacteria based on sensibility against bacteriophages. [Def. G. Hagedorn]
	* Phenotype: (not nomenclatural) appearance of an organism. The same genotype may have different phenotypes, e. g. due to environmental factors. [Def. G. Hagedorn]
	* Physiotype: Robinson, 1969. Physiologically differentiated races of fungi ("physiodeme"). [Def. R. H. Petersen]
	* Serotype (= serovar): (not nomenclatural) infraspecific grouping distinguishable by serological characteristics (based on antibody/antigen reactions). Also: bioserotype. [Def. G. Hagedorn]
	* Sortotype: see agrotype. [Def. R. H. Petersen]
	* Logotype: "type determined from a written description in the absence of an illustration and of a specimen" (http://www.briancoad.com/Dictionary/L.htm) -- explicitly not referring to a specimen, so it can only refer to a circumscription of a taxon.

<p><strong>4. Type terms strongly deprecated because confusing. They may have to be added to the enumeration for backwards compatibility, please comment!</strong></p>
	* Cotype: 1) same as syntype. 2) (erroneous) any and all elements cited by the originating author in the originating publication (cf. <nop>McVaugh, et al., Regn. Veget. 56: 11. 1968). Comment: Because of the inaccuracy of the term, syntype, isotype and paratype should be used. [Def. R. H. Petersen] -- At the moment considered a synonym of Syntype, see list above [GH]

<p><strong>5. Questionable type terms that may have to be added to the enumeration. Please comment!</strong></p>
	* Apotype: a specimen used to supplement the description of a type.
	* Autotype: The Dictionary of Ichthyology has two distinct semantics for this: "1) the type, by original designation, of a taxon -- 2) a specimen designated by the author of a species subsequent to the original publication as being identical to the holotype." (http://www.briancoad.com/Dictionary/A.htm) (Also used in database! http://www.entomology.wisc.edu/irc/irctype.html)
	* Auxiliary Type: (Regn. Veget. 81: 10. 1972.) A specimen or element to serve as type of a subordinate taxon when the type of the major taxon is inadequate to assign subordinate rank names to that type. Also called "Sustaining specimen". [Def. R. H. Petersen]
	* Cheirotype: "a type specimen of a species designated by a manuscript name" (http://www.briancoad.com/Dictionary/C.htm)
	* Chirotype: = Cheirotype
	* Clastotype: an element originating from the same clone as the type (Wherry. Taxon 1: 32. 1952.). Comment: It would appear that Wherry obtained the term elsewhere, but its origin is not known to me. The term would seem useful also in mycology, where a single mycelium can be sampled repeatedly. [Def. R. H. Petersen]
	* collateral type: = any specimen, other than the primary type, used in a species description (http://www.briancoad.com/Dictionary/C.htm)
	* Cytotype: a portion of the type, prepared to exhibit identical cytological features (i.e. chromosomes) as those originally described for the taxon. [Def. R. H. Petersen]
	* Descriptotype: that element or elements on which the original description was based (Fuchs. 1958. Taxon 7: 219). Comment: A useful term, but not sharply enough defined. The following situations lack resolution: 1) when a holotype consists of several specimens (i.e. fungi, mosses, etc.), and only a few were used as the basis for the original description (and often these were discarded; i.e. microscope mounts used for infracellular descriptions and spore measurements). Descriptotype is more limited than holotype. 2) When a number of specimens were used as the basis for the original description (holotype, paratypes), descriptotype becomes more inclusive than holotype. [Def. R. H. Petersen]
	* deuterotype: a replacement type specimen  (http://www.briancoad.com/Dictionary/D.htm)
	* Heautotype: "A specimen figured by an author as an illustration of a species or subspecies which had previously been described as new by him. This is really only one particular kind of a plesiotype." (http://www.coleoptera.org/p890.htm)
	* Homeotype: "A specimen that has been identified by a worker who is recognized as an authority on the group of organisms to which it belongs, after the specimen has been carefully compared by, him with the original type or types of the species or subspecies to which it is referred." (http://www.coleoptera.org/p890.htm) and "A specimen which had been compared with the original type material and found to be identical" (http://www.fish.washington.edu/naturemapping/mollusks/glossary.html) and "a specimen compared with the type by an author other than the author of the species and determined as conspecific." (http://www.briancoad.com/Dictionary/H.htm) (Also used in database! http://www.entomology.wisc.edu/irc/irctype.html)
	* Homoeotype = Homeotype
	* Homotopotype: homoeotype from the type locality.
	* Homotype = Homeotype
	* Hypotype: "a specimen described and/or figured to increase knowledge of a previously described species" (http://www.briancoad.com/Dictionary/H.htm) and "Another name occasionally used is Hypotype, a described or figured specimen used in a publication to extend or correct the knowledge of a previously defined species." (http://www.anri.barc.usda.gov/bnpcu/how2dep.asp) and "Specimen or specimens of a species or subspecies re-described and figured subsequently to the original description. The term is becoming obsolete." (http://www.fish.washington.edu/naturemapping/mollusks/glossary.html)
	* Icotype: a specimen used for identification, worked on by the original author, or collected from the type locality, but not one used for the published description" (http://www.briancoad.com/Dictionary/I.htm)
	* Ideotype: "A specimen collected from some other general locality than the original type (that is, not a topotype) that has been identified by the original author of the species or subspecies to which it is referred at a date subsequent to the publication of the original description. This is like a metatype, except that it does not come from the general locality from which the original type specimens of the species or subspecies were collected." (http://www.coleoptera.org/p890.htm), "a specimen examined by the author of a species but not from the type locality" (http://www.briancoad.com/Dictionary/I.htm) -- Ideotype also used in plant breeding, quite differently!
	* Idiotype = Ideotype
	* Interpretotype: Specimens interpreted by the originating author as belonging to the same taxon as the one proposed. (Fuchs. 1958. Taxon 7: 219). Comment: As proposed, the term seems nothing more than a substitute for "authentic specimens." Note the following difficulties: 1) the possibility of misidentification by the originating author; and 2) uncited specimens merely identified by the originating author. [Def. R. H. Petersen]
	* Isogenotype: ?? (This results in a memorable Google query with nonsense-only results... :-) )
	* Kleptotype: (conventional). A portion of the type specimen purloined and resident in a collection other than that of the originating author. Comment: The term denotes nefarious motive, and has little justification in science. It is usually very difficult to ascertain under what circumstances specimens came into particular hands, especially during the long period in which specimens were shared, divided and distributed very freely by herbaria and institutions. [Def. R. H. Petersen]
	* Merotype: Portions of the holotype detached and resident away from the holotype (Fuchs. 1958. Taxon 7: 219). Comment: A useful term if used as more limited than isotype. The intent of the proposal was to designate portions of the holotype detached and distributed after the originating publication and therefore not specifically cited by the originating author. The term is most germane in regard to cryptogams, where several plants or carpophores may be included in the holotype, or in regard to particular plant organs (i.e. flowers, fruits, etc.) easily detached from the holotype. [Def. R. H. Petersen]
	* Metatype: "A topotype identified by the original describer of the species or subspecies to which it is referred, but at a date subsequent to the publication of the original description." (http://www.coleoptera.org/p890.htm) and "1) a specimen from the type locality determined by the original author subsequent to the original description of the species. - 2) a specimen subsequently determined by the author after comparison with type" (http://www.briancoad.com/Dictionary/M.htm) -- (Also used in database! http://www.entomology.wisc.edu/irc/irctype.html)
	* Morphotype: "A specimen which has been figured in print (a figured specimen), but which has not been used to illustrate anything not previously known about the morphology of the species or subspecies to which it is referred." (http://www.coleoptera.org/p890.htm)
	* Neocotype: a neo-cotype ... 
	* Neotype, established: necessary distinction in this enumeration?
	* Neotype, proposed: necessary distinction in this enumeration?
	* Onomatype "A specimen which has been cited in print (a cited specimen), but which has not been used to illustrate anything not previously known about the morphology of the species or subspecies to which it is referred." (http://www.coleoptera.org/p890.htm)
	* Orthotype: any type by original designation.
	* Phototype (conventional): 1) a photograph of the type; 2) a photograph serving as the type (ICBN, Art. 7). Comment: In recent years, classic herbaria have been photographed, and the photographs, and the photographic collections distributed. In those cases where critical taxonomic characters are visible in photographs, the system works well, but institutions which circulate ONLY photographs stand in danger of violating the spirit of the scientific community, even though justified in their action by the ICBN (... "scrupulously conserved"...). The International Documentation Center has made available phototypes on microfiche. [Def. R. H. Petersen]
	* Phycotype: In lichens, a combination of one mycobiont with different photobiontic algae [Def. G. Hagedorn]
	* Pragmatype: ??
	* Prostype: ??
	* Prototype (= Protype): ??
	* Pseudotype: (Sreemadhaven. 1968. Taxon 17: 586). Any duplicate of the holotype, syntype or paratype that was NOT studied by the originating author up to the time the name of the taxon was published. [Def. R. H. Petersen]
	* Schizotype: (Korf and Rogers. 1967. Taxon 16: 22) The one specimen or other element from the original material retained in a taxon by an author who has treated in a single publication all of the syntypes of a taxon and has specifically excluded from the taxon each of the other eligible syntypes. Comment: Proposed as a special kind of implied lectotype, the term, while useful, inflicts additional literature review beyond the originating publication and other well-known works. The examples cited are all from the fungi. [Def. R. H. Petersen] -- "schizotype = a syntype regarded by a subsequent author as the type of a taxon but not specifically designated as the type for that taxon" (http://www.briancoad.com/Dictionary/S.htm)"
	* Symbiotype: host specimen from which a new symbiotic or parasitic taxon was described (=symbiotype specimen; see Frey, J.K., T.L. Yates, D.W. Duszynski, W.L. Gannon and S.L. Gardner. 1992. Designation and curatorial management of type host specimens (symbiotypes) for new parasite species. Journal of Parasitology 78: 930-932.) [Def. G. Hagedorn]
	* Typotype: When a description or illustration serves as a type, the specimen(s) on which the description and/or illustration was based can be termed the typotype (Taxon 13: 113. 1964). [Def. R. H. Petersen]
	* Typus conservandus: Latin, "a type to be conserved;" abbreviated typ. cons. (<nop>McVaugh et al. 1968. Regn. Veget. 56: 26). Comment: Homonyms usually are separated taxonomically based on their types. Thus, in such cases, among others, it may be exigent to conserve a type and thus the concept of the name. [Def. R. H. Petersen]. Note W. Gams: Most important case is ICBN Art. 14.3, where the application of a taxon may be conserved through a changed type (e. g. Rhizoctonia DC. 1805 typified by R. solani Kühn of later date than the original type).
	* Xerotypus/xerotype: (not found by Google!)
