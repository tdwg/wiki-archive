RicardoPereira - Presentation: [[%ATTACHURL%/GUID_1_Plenary_3_Definitions_RicardoPereira.ppt]]

Jessie Kennedy - Presentation: [[%ATTACHURL%/GUID_1_Plenary_4_ReqsForTaxonNamesAndConcepts_JessieKennedy.ppt]]

RicardoPereira - Presentation: [[%ATTACHURL%/GUID_1_Plenary_5_ReqsForSpecimensAndCollections_RicardoPereira.ppt]]


   * Greg Riccardi - Collections Management software does hold ids in the short-term
   * Peter Dawyndt/Sally Hinchcliffe/RichPyle - doesn't work now in practice with current practices, numbers not necessarily unique, history varies
   * George Garrity - Also live samples
   * Jessie Kennedy - Clarify why discussed relationships between GUIDs after saying this wasn't the subject
   * RicardoPereira /Donald Hobern - background for what we are doing
   * Bob Peet - Be sensitive to the needs for observations, etc.
   * MattJones - Discussing specimens is interesting because deals with concrete examples, which doesn't apply to observations
   * George Garrity - Rights management need to be discussed
   * Scott Federhen - Even for specimens, the record is digital so not clear
   * Greg Riccardi - QOS is the real issue with GUIDs

 
   * RodericPage - Presentation: [[%ATTACHURL%/GUID_1_Plenary_8_GUIDs_Metadata_RDF_RodericPage.ppt]]

   * Jessie Kennedy - Your inference example - should we believe these inferences
   * Sally Hinchcliffe - It's the metadata that helps us to know
   * MattJones - Incompatible inferences are certainly a problem

 
   * Ben Szekely - Presentation: [[%ATTACHURL%/GUID_1_Plenary_6_LifeSciencesIndentifiers_BenSzekely.ppt]]
   * Scott Federhen - GenBank not guaranteed to return same byte sequence - FASTA files can be changed by changes to organism names
   * RichPyle - When should versions be used? 
   * Ben Szekely - recommend you don't, because versioning should really be addressed by metadata linkages
   * Sally Hinchcliffe - What of multiple services for same LSID? 
   * Ben Szekely - We developed a service to allow resolvers to provide information to originators that they have foreign metadata for the LSID


   * George Garrity - Presentation: [[%ATTACHURL%/GUID_1_Plenary_7_DigitalObjectIdentifiers_GeorgeGarrity.ppt]]
   * Paul Kirk - Cost is the issue.
   * Robert Huber - For WDC-Mare, c. 25 cents per DOI vs. 1000&#65533; data acquisition costs per data set
   * Scott Federhen - RA maintenance of ids is still a cost
   * George Garrity - what is the user community? What would they pay for?
 

   * Donald Hobern - Presentation: [[%ATTACHURL%/GUID_1_Plenary_9_IdentifyingObjects_DonaldHobern.ppt]]
   * Stan Blum - Do we ever have external objects to which we want to assign GUIDs?
   * RogerHyam - Objects can have different facets?
   * Sally Hinchcliffe - Separate between "should" and "is".
   * RichPyle - Do GUIDs get moved when specimens are transferred to other organizations?
   * Scott Federhen - Common situation e.g. with Jansen butterflies
   * Stan Blum - This sort of thing will be modeled through applicability statements
   * Ben Szekely - My instinct would be to assign new id with link to new authority
   * Donald Hobern - May wish to attach non-actionable GUIDs to objects and actionable ones to data objects
   * RichPyle - Applies whenever multiple providers describe same thing
   * RicardoPereira - Catalogue numbers already exist - cannot change this - need to concentrate on linkages between digital objects
   * Stan Blum - Cancelation of duplicates requires GUIDs?
   * MattJones - Need also to meet needs of students and professors sharing data
   * Jessie Kennedy/Sally Hinchcliffe - We musn't get too hung up on opacity
   * RicardoPereira - Let's list criteria we have to evaluate systems
   * Andrew Jones - If we adopt LSID, would it not be sensible to adopt standards in use with other LSID implementations, etc.
   * Peter Dawyndt - Always need to be able to handle having multiple identifiers for same thing
   * Jessie Kennedy - Must address the requirements
