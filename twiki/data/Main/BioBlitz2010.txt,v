---++TDWG !BioBlitz 2010
|<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/63319497@@N00/3645940792/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2423/3645940792_d94a68dcfe_m.jpg" align="left" /></a>| The TDWG 2010 Annual Meeting will sponsor a Techno/BioBlitz event as part of the conference activities held in Woods Hole, Massachusetts, USA.   It will be held on Wednesday, September 29th with additional opportunities to participate in identification and data processing the following day.  This event will provide TDWG participants with opportunities to discover and explore an array of natural habitats in and around the village of Woods Hole while providing opportunities for those with technical skills to participate in the capture, processing and presentation of data.   The event is not intended to cover the strict scope of a formal bioblitz, which generally consists of a 24-hour intensive inventory of a rather tightly constrained location.  Instead, this event will combine casual, guided field trips within the Woods Hole village and some select locations in the area, with a support facility at the TDWG venue for identification, imaging, and computer support.<p><font color="red">New:</font> [[BioBlitz2010FieldTrips#Schedule][Sign up here for bioblitz field trips]]<br><br>If you are a developer that wants to contribute developing software for the Bioblitz, check out the BioBlitz2010ProgrammerGuidelines|

The goals of the TDWG Techno/Bioblitz are to: <br>

   * Enable observational data to be captured in a manner that supports the overall goals of TDWG to &#8220;develop and promote standards for recording data about organisms. &#8220;
   * Provide an opportunity to demonstrate these standards &#8220;in action&#8221; and evaluate their potential for uptake and use in a real world,  &#8220;citizen science&#8221; event.
   * Provide technically-oriented meeting participants the opportunity to showcase their technical skills and software solutions by supporting the event.
   * Serve as a testbed for experiments in social and semantic computing for citizen science.

---+++Participate
|We encourage all TDWG 2010 attendees to participate in the bioblitz either through joining a field trip, performing identifications and microscope work in the lab,  or at a technical level by supporting data capture, visualization and integration.   For the field and lab-related events we are further interested in identifying individuals who might be interested in bringing specialized collecting equipment (nets, light, etc) or identification guides for use with one of the events.   We are also interested in identifying volunteers who might be interested in: <br>1. Serving as a taxonomic guide for one of the field trips.  We have some local volunteers who may have general knowledge of the event but who might appreciate deeper knowledge. <br>2. Serving as an expert in the lab &#8220;basecamp&#8221; with access to field guides, stereo-microscopy and other advanced imaging equipment. If you have special requests or would like to contribute equipment or expertise, please contact David Remsen (dremsen@@gbif.org).|<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/12978307@@N00/3602445776/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3366/3602445776_14c2c80244_m.jpg" /></a>|
 

---+++Facilities
|<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/microagua/3669099439/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3544/3669099439_efb0059265_m.jpg" align="left" /></a>|The Marine Biological Laboratory (MBL) is supporting the Techno/Bioblitz through the provision of a large open laboratory located in the Loeb teaching facility.   This room, and several adjoining rooms will provide ample space for supporting the event and will serve as the bioblitz &#8220;base camp.&#8221;  It will remain open throughout the day and evening of the event (Wednesday), and also the following day (Thursday). It will provide bench space that will support 6 separate bioblitz identification &#8220;stations.&#8221;   Each station will provide reference materials, trays, jars, small tanks, as appropriate to each station as well as the equipment listed below.   Participants are also encouraged to bring their own identification materials and reference guides as aids for identification.   The lab will serve as a base for:|
   * Identification of botanical and (small) zoological specimens.   We will provide jars, buckets and trays for capture and transport of small terrestrial and marine specimens to the lab for identification, scope work and image capture.   We ask those bringing samples back to consider returning live specimens back to their capture location.
   * Temporary (live) storage of small marine samples &#8211; The facility includes shallow circulating seawater trays for temporary storage of marine invertebrates, marine algae, etc.    We will also provide containers and small aquaria for temporary housing.
   * Microscopy &#8211; the MBL and the Carl Zeiss Facility are offering a range of microscopy and imaging equipment for identification and digital imaging of specimens.  In addition we will have access to a digital SLR stand with lighting for capturing high-resolution macro-photographs.   See table below for details.
   * Computing &#8211; The lab will provide computer hardware to support image capture for each identification station (below) the lab will also include space for participants to set up computers if they wish space for development.  In addition, a separate computer-support facility is available for coding and development at the MBL Club, which will supply power, tables, and network connections.
   * Macrophotography &#8211; the lab will support at least one digital camera stand with macro photography capabilities.   This setup will be staffed by a support person familiar in its use.

The layout is provisionally as listed below but final equipment setup will be laid out to maximize flexible use.

| Station # | Taxonomic Focus | Imaging Capability |
| 1 | Marine Invertebrates/Fish | (2) Zeiss Stemi 2000 (1 w/digital imaging) |
| 2 | Terrestrial plants | (1) Macrophotography Station, (1) Zeiss Stemi 2000 (1 w/digital imaging) |
| 3 | Insects/Arthropods | (2) Zeiss Stemi 2000 (1 w/digital imaging) |
| 4 | Macroalgae | (2) Zeiss Stemi 2000 (1 w/digital imaging) |
| 5 | Fungi | (2) Zeiss Stemi 2000 (1 w/digital imaging) |
| 6 | Micro-organisms (!ZooPlankton/Phytoplankton & Protists) | (1) Zeiss Discovery v.8, (1) Zeiss Stemi 2000 w/digital imaging |

---+++BIOBus
|<img src="http://biobus.ca/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/MG_0059-BIObus-in-NewMexico-PL1-399x300.jpg" width="200" height="150">|The Biodiversity Institute of Ontario and the International Barcode of Life will participate in the bioblitz with their mobile field research vehicle, the <a href="http://biobus.ca/">BIOBus!</a>   Since 2008, the BIOBus has been carrying researchers to biodiversity hotspots across North America to collect insects and other invertebrates.  Hundreds of thousands of specimens representing over 10,000 species have been collected.   When the BIOBus returns to the lab in Guelph, Ontario,  each specimen is photographed and a tissue sample is analysed to recover a DNA barcode.    Come and join the BIOBus and participate in collecting and preparing specimens for barcoding.   View <a href=http://dl.dropbox.com/u/523458/BIOBus%20Postcard.pdf>BIOBus pamphlet.</a> |
---++Field Trips
|<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/12978307@@N00/3624322607/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3408/3624322607_be47d9a7c8_m.jpg" align="left" /></a>|The TDWG Techno/Bioblitz will feature a series of scheduled field trips dedicated to species observations and collection.    The field trips are divided into two roughly equal blocks of approximately 2-3 hours with a few specialized outliers.  One block occupies most of the morning from 09:30 till lunchtime and the second occupies the afternoon from 13:30 till approximately 16:00. <br> <br> Each block offers field trips that provide opportunities with the following general taxonomic focal areas:|<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/takomabibelot/3827847242/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2441/3827847242_b93b13f622_m.jpg" /></a>|


   * Insects and non-insect arthropods
   * Marine Invertebrates and Fish
   * Fungi
   * Higher Plants (including marine and estuarine)
   * Microorganisms
   * Birds
   * Macroalgae (Seaweeds)

We expect to have all field trips provided with a local person with some expertise in the taxonomic area who can serve as a guide to the field trip location.  We appreciate any additional TDWG meeting volunteers who may wish to add their own expertise.

---+++Locations
|<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/48757934@@N08/4459318303/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4065/4459318303_63987e1efe_m.jpg" /></a>|Field trips include those confined to walking distance within the village as well as a few to some special external locations that require transportation.  These remote field trips, with the exception of the whale watch excursion (see below),  are all within a 30 min or less drive from the TDWG meeting. We will provide vans for transport to these locations.  The maximum number of participants for these off-site field trips will be dictated by interest, and the number of available vehicles.   These off-site trips will likely take more time given the need for transportation but have been selected for their relative species richness and specialized habitat.|

| Note,  that there is limited availability (15 max.) to participate in a collecting trip on the MBL fishing vessel, R.V. Gemma.  </p> *Whale watch excursion* &#8211; We have made arrangements with a local whale watch company for those who are willing to spend an entire day away from the meeting for the chance to see the local marine mammal and pelagic bird offerings.   This excursion carries additional costs to participate and sign-up is via the TDWG registration site. | <img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3295/2738856627_2188f934e7_m.jpg"> |

---+++Schedule and Signup
|The [[BioBlitz2010FieldTrips#Schedule][schedule]] provides information about each planned field trip, and the opportunity to [[BioBlitz2010FieldTrips#Schedule][sign up]].  Note that there are 3 trips that fall outside the two major time blocks:  one early birding walk and two evening events. <br> <br>This schedule has been developed to allow TDWG participants a chance to attend both Bioblitz-related activities as well as other side events that may be scheduled on Wednesday,  29 September.   Participants may choose to attend a mix of field trips, lab activities and meeting side events.   We have tried to have some redundancy between morning and afternoon trips to ensure there is something for everyone. Each field trip is linked to a web-based poll where participants are encourage to express their interest in a trip.  Please try to limit your signup to no more than one morning and one afternoon event.    If you feel strongly about two parallel trips, put a number in braces &#8220;ex, (1) or (2)&#8221; indicating your preference.   We will close the polls on Saturday,  25 September at 1700 local time.   Additional signup will then take place at the main TDWG registration desk area. Click [[BioBlitz2010FieldTrips#Schedule][here]] for the full listing of field trips and to sign up.|<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/takomabibelot/2725403060/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3277/2725403060_e17aea180d_m.jpg" /></a>|

The TDWG 2010 Annual Meeting will sponsor a Techno/BioBlitz event as part of the conference activities held in Woods Hole, Massachusetts, USA.   It will be held on Wednesday, September 29th with additional opportunities to participate in identification and data processing the following day.  This event will provide TDWG participants with opportunities to discover and explore an array of natural habitats in and around the village of Woods Hole while providing opportunities for those with technical skills to participate in the capture, processing and presentation of data.   The event is not intended to cover the strict scope of a formal bioblitz, which generally consists of a 24-hour intensive inventory of a rather tightly constrained location.  Instead, this event will combine casual, guided field trips within the Woods Hole village and some select locations in the area, with a support facility at the TDWG venue for identification, imaging, and computer support.
The goals of the TDWG Techno/Bioblitz are to:
d14 2
a15 6
We encourage all TDWG 2010 attendees to participate in the bioblitz either through joining a field trip, performing identifications and microscope work in the lab,  or at a technical level by supporting data capture, visualization and integration.   For the field and lab-related events we are further interested in identifying individuals who might be interested in bringing specialized collecting equipment (nets, light, etc) or identification guides for use with one of the events.   We are also interested in identifying volunteers who might be interested in:

1.	Serving as a taxonomic guide for one of the field trips.  We have some local volunteers who may have general knowledge of the event but who might appreciate deeper knowledge. 
2.	Serving as an expert in the lab &#8220;basecamp&#8221; with access to field guides, stereo-microscopy and other advanced imaging equipment

The TDWG 2010 Annual meeting will sponsor a !BioBlitz  as part of the conference activities held in Woods Hole.  It will be held on 29 September 2010 with the following day available for data processing and species identification. This event will provide TDWG participants with opportunities to explore Cape Cod habitats, inventory some of the local (and introduced) species, and get engaged in the use of TDWG standards to capture, publish and utilize the data generated.   The primary purpose of the !BioBlitz is to serve as a testbed and showcase for both TDWG standards and any related technologies (name matching, annotations, distribution mapping, semantic computing, etc.).

The goals of the TDWG !Bioblitz are to:
   * Provide participants an opportunity to explore and discover the natural surroundings and some of the local species in the Woods Hole region. 
   * Enable observational data to be captured in a manner that supports the overall goals of TDWG to &#8220;develop and promote standards for recording data about organisms."

The !BioBlitz will be composed of multiple pre-defined field events.   These events include walks through terrestrial habitats both in the village and in nearby reserves as well as boat trips and coastal walks.   A complete list will be available and participants will be able to be included in more than one.   An event leader will serve as a guide and one or more individuals will be encouraged to act as data recorders.   Non-destructive sampling will also be allowed and a lab will be provided for further identifications and imaging. Participants will be encouraged to take photographs of observed species both in the field or from the lab with the result that a single observation may be linked to one or more photographs or other media files (sound files, mpegs, etc).

*Other Ideas*
a39 3
We might also set-up a forum/repository where people can present challenges, and offer possible solutions. Here are two examples:
   a. Data sensitivity is an issue in citizen science, since we typically do not want to publish the exact location of threatened or endangered species. Can we identify the endangered species of the host city, make observations of them, and automatically obscure the location via our workflow (I.e. set up a workflow that notices which observations should not be published at fine geospatial granularity)?
   a. Can we do [[http://bit.ly/5EmQAv][smart monitoring]] (i.e. iterative model development) of an invasive species in the region?

*Technology Ideas*
d45 7
a51 1
Note: Technology ideas are now being discussed at [[http://groups.google.com/group/tdwg-bioblitz/]] 
d53 1
a53 1
Visualisation could be through Google Earth with all images georeferenced and with popup links to annotation tools to crowdsource identifications.  The final product could be a .kmz with all the images and comments linked.
d55 2
a56 1
Data could be collected using geo-enabled mobile phones submitting to a Google Fusion Table, which rapidly offers the Google Earth/Maps visualization. 
d58 2
a59 1
We could use our open source pocket [[http://ereleve.codeplex.com//][eReleve]], for a start. It needs to be ported to other plateforms (windows mobile phone only), but we would be happy to do it and include the KeytoNature work... 
d61 2
a62 1
Preparing the tools could be the goal of a distributed hackathon earlier in the year.
d64 2
a65 20
A data-collection web app could present a Google Maps interface for geo-referencing an observation.  A DarwinCore form-interface provides the template for the data entry with the geospatial information already loaded.   The user would input a scientific name which,  using GBIF name services, could provide an auto-complete function.  When the name is correctly input, a second web-service call would insert a taxonomic identifier and complete the higher taxonomy (Catalogue of Life default,  other select catalogues as fill-in).   We might get someone like Javier de la Torre to develop this to showcase Vizzuality .

These identification keys designed for handhold devices from the EU project K2Nature use the TDWG SDD standard as underlying data standard. It may be an idea to try to use them for the planned BioBlitzes? They work on modern mobile phones and most of the existing keys target pupils, younger students or the public at large?

*Biodiversity 2010 events*

There are many events planned in the framework of Biodiversity 2010 including BioBlitzes. 

There is an official list on the Countdown 2010 (IUCN) website : [[http://www.countdown2010.net/byse/]]  . It would be very relevant to TDWG to identify the events where we could advertise TDWG. Also the TDWG 2010 related events could be advertised there.

The idea we discussed in Montpellier is to conduct a mini-bioblitz at next year's TDWG.

Doing this would provide ...

*To do:*
a23 10
   i. Determine scope. What will be the geographic extent? Will the goal be an ATBI, or something more modest? One option would be to attempt a complete inventory of plants and animals in the area immediately adjacent to the conference center, and to also support more casual, less focused observations throughout the city. We could also send teams on missions to areas of interest. 
   i. Recruit ringleaders.
   i. Recruit expertise. Will be depending entirely on the collective intelligence of TDWG for taxon identification? Even if so, we should have people on the hook to assist in identifying plants, birds, invertebrates, herps (depending on location), etc. We should, if possible, recruit local experts, especially for advice on invasives. We can also make use of a variety of crowdsourcing tools for identification, e.g. [[http://www.ispot.org.uk/][iSpot]], [[http://inaturalist.org/][iNaturalist]], etc.
   i. Determine a schedule. Here are some options: <br>
      a. Dedicate Sunday to the blitz. The rest of the week would be for processing and publishing the data. Under this model, we would still accept observations reported throughout the week, but would aim to do reach most of our observation goals on the Sunday. <br>
      a. Dedicate Monday afternoon to the blitz. A lot of groundwork would already be done by volunteers, and then, after lunch on Monday, we would unleash the entire meeting into the blitz area. (This is probably a bad idea.) <br>
      a. Run the blitz in parallel with the meeting, with a core team always blitzing, and other delegates drifting in and out.
