---# TWiki Skins

_Skins overlay regular templates to give different looks and feels to TWiki screens._

---++ Overview

TWiki uses TWikiTemplates files as the basis of all the screens it uses to interact with users. Each screen has an associated template file that contains the basic layout of the screen. This is then filled in by the code to generate what you see in the browser.

TWiki ships with a default set of template files that give a basic look-and-feel. TWiki also includes support for _skins_ that can be selected to give different, more sophisticated, look and feels. A default TWiki installation will usually start up with the PatternSkin already selected. Skins may also be defined by third parties and loaded into a TWiki installation to give more options. To see how TWiki looks when *no* skin is selected, [[%SCRIPTURL{"view"}%/%WEB%/%TOPIC%?skin=not_a_skin][view this topic with a non-existant skin]].

Topic text is not affected by the choice of skin, though a skin can be defined to use a CSS (Cascading Style Sheet), which can sometimes give a radically different appearance to the text.

---++ Changing the default TWiki skin

TWiki default ships with the skin PatternSkin activated. If you want to modify the layout, colors or even the templates to suit your own needs, have a look first at the topics PatternSkinCustomization and PatternSkinCssCookbook.

---++ Defining Skins

You may want to define your own skin, for example to comply with corporate web guidelines, or because you have a aesthetic vision that you want to share.

The TWikiTemplates files used for skins are located in the =twiki/templates= directory and are named according to the skin: ==&lt;scriptname&gt;.&lt;skin&gt;.tmpl==. Skin files may also be defined in TWiki topics - see TWikiTemplates for details.

To start creating a new skin, copy the default TWikiTemplates (like =view.tmpl=), or copy an existing skin to use as a base for your own skin. You should only need to copy the files you intend to customise, as TWiki can be configured to fall back to another skin if a template is not defined in your skin. Name the files as described above (for example =view.myskin.tmpl=.

For your own TWiki skin you are encouraged to show a small 80x31 pixel <a href="http://twiki.org/"><img src="%PUBURL%/%TWIKIWEB%/TWikiLogos/T-logo-80x15.gif" alt="This site is powered by the TWiki collaboration platform" width="80" height="15" title="This site is powered by the TWiki collaboration platform" border="0" /></a> logo at the bottom of your skin:

=&lt;a href="http://twiki.org/"&gt;&lt;img src="%<nop>PUBURL%/%<nop>TWIKIWEB%/TWikiLogos/T-logo-80x15.gif" alt="This site is powered by the TWiki collaboration platform" width="80" height="15" title="This site is powered by the TWiki collaboration platform" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;=

The standard TWiki skins show the logo in the =%<nop>WEBCOPYRIGHT%= variable.

__%X% Note:__ Two skin names have _reserved_ meanings; =text= skin, and skin names starting with =rss= have [[#HardCodedSkins][hard-coded meanings]].

The following template files are used for TWiki screens, and are referenced in the TWiki core code. If a skin doesn't define its own version of a template file, then TWiki will fall back to the next skin in the skin path, or finally, to the default version of the template file.

=twiki.tmpl= is a master template conventionally used by other templates, but not used directly by code.


__%X% Note:__ It is best to create these templates for your skin. If you =TMPL:INCLUDE= the default templates, or templates from other skins, when you are defining your own skin, you run the risk that the included file might change and break your skin. 

---+++ Partial customisation, or adding in new features to an existing skin

You can use recusion in the TMPL:INCLUDE chain (eg twiki.classic.tmpl contains =%<nop>TMPL:INCLUDE{"twiki"}%=, the templating system will include the next twiki.SKIN in the skin path. 
For example, to create a customisation of pattern skin, where you _only_ want to remove the edit & WYSIWYG buttons from view page, you create only a =view.yourlocal.tmpl=:
<verbatim>
%TMPL:INCLUDE{"view"}%
%TMPL:DEF{"edit_topic_link"}%%TMPL:END%
%TMPL:DEF{"edit_wysiwyg_link"}%%TMPL:END%
</verbatim>
and then set =SKIN=yourlocal,pattern=.

Because ClassicSkin and the default templates use the same Template definition names, you can over-ride the edit links in them (or any skin derived from them) using the same =view.yourlocal.tmpl= (just set SKIN=yourlocal,classic either in %MAINWEB%.TWikiPreferences for globally, or a Web's <nop>Webname.<nop>WebPreferences for a particular web) 

---++ Variables in Skins

You can use [[TWikiTemplates#TemplateVariables][template variables]], TWikiVariables, and other predefined variables to compose your skins. Some commonly used variables in skins:

| *Variable:* | *Expanded to:* |
| =%<nop>WEBLOGONAME%= | Filename of web logo |
| =%<nop>WEBLOGOIMG%= | Image URL of web logo |
| =%<nop>WEBLOGOURL%= | Link of web logo |
| =%<nop>WEBLOGOALT%= | Alt text of web logo |
| =%<nop>WIKILOGOURL%= | Link of page logo |
| =%<nop>WIKILOGOIMG%= | Image URL of page logo |
| =%<nop>WIKILOGOALT%= | Alt text of page logo |
| =%<nop>WEBBGCOLOR%= | Web-specific background color, defined in the WebPreferences |
| =%<nop>WIKITOOLNAME%= | The name of your TWiki site |
| =%<nop>SCRIPTURL%= | The script URL of TWiki |
| =%<nop>SCRIPTURLPATH%= | The script URL path |
| =%<nop>SCRIPTSUFFIX%= | The script suffix, ex: =.pl=, =.cgi= |
| =%<nop>WEB%= | The name of the current web. |
| =%<nop>TOPIC%= | The name of the current topic. |
| =%<nop>WEBTOPICLIST%= | Common links of current web, defined in the WebPreferences. It includes a [[#GoBox][Go box]] |
| =%<nop>TEXT%= | The topic text, e.g. the content that can be edited |
| =%<nop>META{"form"}%= | [[TWikiForms][TWikiForm]], if any |
| =%<nop>META{"attachments"}%= | FileAttachment table |
| =%<nop>META{"parent"}%= | The topic parent |
| =%<nop>EDITTOPIC%= | Edit link |
| =%<nop>REVTITLE%= | The revision title, if any, ex: =(r1.6)= |
| =%<nop>REVINFO%= | Revision info, ex: =r1.6 - 24 Dec 2002 - 08:12 GMT - %WIKIUSERNAME%= |
| =%<nop>WEBCOPYRIGHT%= | Copyright notice, defined in the WebPreferences |
| =%<nop>BROADCASTMESSAGE%= | Broadcast message at the beginning of your view template, can be used to alert users of scheduled downtimes; can be set in %LOCALSITEPREFS% |

#GoBox
---++ The "Go" Box and Navigation Box

The default skins include a [[GoBox]["Go" box]], also called "Jump" box, to jump to a topic.

The box also understands URLs, e.g. you can type =http://www.google.com/= to jump to an external web site. The feature is handy if you build a skin that has a select box of frequently used links, like Intranet home, employee database, sales database and such. A little <nop>JavaScript gets into action on the =onchange= method of the select tag to fill the selected URL into the "Go" box field, then submits the form.

Here is an example form that has a select box and the "Go" box for illustration purposes. You need to have <nop>JavaScript enabled for this to work:

<form name="sample" action="%SCRIPTURLPATH{"view"}%/%WEB%/%TOPIC%">
<table border="0" cellpadding="5" bgcolor="#DDDDDD"><tr><td colspan="2">
Bare bones header, for demo only
</td></tr><tr><td>
Navigate:
</td><td>
<select name="sel" onchange="this.form.topic.value=this.options[this.selectedIndex].value; this.form.submit()">
<option selected="selected" value="">...</option>
<option value="http://twiki.org/">Intranet home</option>
<option value="%MAINWEB%.%WIKIUSERSTOPIC%">Employee index</option>
<option value="%MAINWEB%.%HOMETOPIC%">%MAINWEB% web</option>
<option value="%TWIKIWEB%.%HOMETOPIC%">%TWIKIWEB% web</option>
<option value="http://www.google.com/">Google</option>
<option value="http://www.yahoo.com/">Yahoo!</option>
</select>
</td></tr><tr><td>
Jump:
</td><td>
<input type="text" name="topic" size="16" />
</td></tr></table>
</form> 

__Note:__ Redirect to a URL only works if it is enabled in =configure= (Miscellaneous, ={AllowRedirectUrl}=).

---++ Using Cascading Style Sheets

CSS files are gererally attachments to the skin topic that are included in the the skin templates - in the case of PatternSkin in the template =styles.pattern.tmpl=.

   * To see how CSS is used in the default TWiki skin, see: PatternSkin
   * If you write a complete new skin, this is the syntax to use in a template file:
<verbatim>
<style type='text/css' media='all'>@@import url('%PUBURLPATH%/%TWIKIWEB%/MySkin/mystyle.css');</style>
</verbatim>

---++ Attachment Tables
Controlling the look and feel of attachment tables is a little bit more complex than for the rest of a skin. By default, the attachment table is a standard TWiki table, and the look is controlled in the same way as other tables. In a very few cases you may want to change the _content_ of the table as well.

The format of standard attachment tables is defined through the use of special _TWiki template macros_ which by default, are defined in the =attachtables.tmpl= template using the =%TMPL:DEF= macro syntax described in TWikiTemplates. These macros are:
| *Macro* | *Description* |
| =ATTACH:files:header= | Standard title bar |
| =ATTACH:files:row= | Standard row |
| =ATTACH:files:footer= | Footer for all screens |
| =ATTACH:files:header:A= | Title bar for upload screens, with attributes column |
| =ATTACH:files:row:A= | Row for upload screen |
| =ATTACH:files:footer:A= | Footer for all screens |

The format of tables of file versions in the Upload screen can also be changed, using the macros:
| *Macro* | *Description* |
| =ATTACH:versions:header= | Header for versions table on upload screen |
| =ATTACH:versions:row= | Row format for versions table on upload screen |
| =ATTACH:versions:footer= | Footer for versions table on upload screen |

The =ATTACH:row= macros are expanded for each file in the attachment table, using the following special tags:
| *Tag* | *Description* |
| =%A_URL%= | URL that will recover the file |
| =%A_REV%= | Revision of this file |
| =%A_ICON%= | A file icon suitable for representing the attachment content |
| =%A_FILE%= | The name of the file |
| =%A_SIZE%= | The size of the file |
| =%A_DATE%= | The date the file was uploaded |
| =%A_USER%= | The user who uploaded it |
| =%A_COMMENT%= | The comment they put in when uploading it |
| =%A_ATTRS%= | The attributes of the file as seen on the upload screen e.g "h" for a hidden file |

---++ Packaging and Publishing Skins

See TWiki:Plugins/SkinPackagingHowTo and TWiki:Plugins/SkinDeveloperFAQ

---++ Browsing Installed Skins

You can try out all installed skins in the TWikiSkinBrowser.

---++ Activating Skins

TWiki uses a _skin search path_, which lets you combine skins additively. The skin path is defined using a combination of TWikiVariables and URL parameters.

TWiki works by asking for a template for a particular function - for example, 'view'. The detail of how templates are searched for is described in TWikiTemplates, but in summary, the templates directory is searched for a file called <code>view.</code><i>skin</i><code>.tmpl</code>, where _skin_ is the name of the skin e.g. =pattern=. If no template is found, then the fallback is to use =view.tmpl=. Each skin on the path is searched for in turn. For example, if you have set the skin path to =local,pattern= then =view.local.tmpl= will be searched for first, then =view.pattern.tmpl= and finally =view.tmpl=.

The basic skin is defined by a =SKIN= setting:

   * =Set SKIN = catskin, bearskin=

You can also add a parameter to the URL, such as =?skin=catskin,bearskin=:

   * %SCRIPTURL{view}%/%WEB%/%TOPIC%?skin=catskin,bearskin

Setting =SKIN= (or the =?skin= parameter in the URL) replaces the existing skin path setting, for the current page only. You can also _extend_ the existing skin path as well, using _covers_.

   * =Set COVER = ruskin=

This pushes a different skin to the front of the skin search path (so for our example above, that final skin path will be =ruskin, catskin, bearskin=). There is also an equivalent =cover= URL parameter. The difference between setting =SKIN= vs. =COVER= is that if the chosen template is not found (e.g., for included templates), =SKIN= will fall back onto the next skin in line, or the default skin, if only one skin was present, while =COVER= will always fall back onto the current skin.

An example would be invoking the printable mode, which is achieved by applying =?cover=print=. The =view.print.tmpl= simply invokes the =viewprint= template for the current skin which then can appropriately include all other used templates for the current skin. Where the printable mode be applied by using =SKIN=, all skins would have the same printable appearance.

The full skin path is built up as follows: =SKIN= setting (or =?skin= if it is set), then =COVER= setting is added, then =?cover=.

#HardCodedSkins
---++ Hard-Coded Skins

The =text= skin is reserved for TWiki internal use.

Skin names starting with =rss= also have a special meaning; if one or more of the skins in the skin path starts with 'rss' then 8-bit characters will be encoded as XML entities in the output, and the =content-type= header will be forced to =text/xml=.

_Skins overlay regular templates with alternate header/footer layouts; topic text is not affected_
d10 11
a20 1
Skins are customized TWikiTemplates files. You can use skins to change the look of a %WIKITOOLNAME% topic, for example, the layout of the header and footer. Rendered text between header and footer does __not__ change. You can also use skins to define an alternate view, like a view optimized for printing.
d24 5
a28 1
Skin files are located in the =twiki/templates= directory and are named with the syntax: ==&lt;scriptname&gt;.&lt;skin&gt;.tmpl==. For example, the *Printable* skin for the =view= template is =view.print.tmpl=.
d30 45
a74 1
Use the existing TWikiTemplates (like =view.tmpl=) or skin files as a base for your own skin, name it for example =view.myskin.tmpl=.

The =%<nop>WEBTOPICLIST%= includes a "Go" box to jump to a topic. The box also understand URLs, e.g. you can type http://www.google.com/ to jump to an external web site. The feature is handy if you build a skin that has a select box of frequently used links, like Intranet home, employee database, sales database and such. A little <nop>JavaScript gets into action on the onSelect method of the select tag to fill the selected URL into the "Go" box field, then submits the form.

Although work is underway at TWiki:Codev.CssClassNames, the regular templates files currently do not use style sheets.  Many skin developers, however, choose to use them; it helps in separating style from content.
d134 1
a134 1
Example: To use a style sheet for the broadcast message, add this to =view.myskin.tmpl=:
d136 1
d138 1
a138 13
<style type="text/css">
.broadcastmessage {
	 background: yellow; display:block;
	 border-style:solid;border-width: 2px;border-color:red;
}
.broadcastmessage strong {color: red}
</style>
</verbatim>

Then add a div tag to the =%<nop>BROADCASTMESSAGE%= variable located after the =#PageTop= anchor or after the opening form tag:

<verbatim>
<div class="broadcastmessage"> %BROADCASTMESSAGE% </div>
d142 1
a142 1
Controlling the look and feel of attachment tables is a little bit more complex than for the rest of a skin. By default the attachment table is a standard TWiki table, and the look is controlled in the same ay as other tables. In a very few cases you may want to change the _content_ of the table as well.
d144 1
a144 1
The format of standard attachment tables is defined through the use of special _TWiki template macros_ which by default are defined in the =templates/twiki.tmpl= template using the =%TMPL:DEF= macro syntax described in TWikiTemplates. These macros are:
d152 2
a153 1
The format of tables of file versions in the Upload screen are also formattable, using the macros:
d162 1
a162 1
| =%A_REV%= | Revision of this file e.g. "1.1" |
a170 2
Note: it is easy to change the look and feel for an entire site by editing the =twiki.tmpl= template file. However, to simplify upgrading, you should avoid doing this. Instead, write a skin-specific template file e.g. =attach.myskin.tmpl= and use =%TMPL:INCLUDE{attach.myskin.tmpl}%= to include it in each of your skin files. As long as it it included _after_ twiki.tmpl, your macro definitions will override the defaults defined there.

d177 1
a177 1
You can try all installed skins in TWikiSkinBrowser.
d181 19
a199 1
A skin can be activated in two ways:
d201 2
a202 2
	* Define the =SKIN= Preference variable in TWiki.TWikiPreferences, one of the WebPreferences, or in a user - %WIKIUSERNAME% - topic.
		* =Set SKIN = print=
d204 1
a204 3
	* Add =?skin=name= to the URL, for this example:
		* %SCRIPTURL%/view%SCRIPTSUFFIX%/%WEB%/%TOPIC%?skin=print (for the print view skin)
		* %SCRIPTURL%/view%SCRIPTSUFFIX%/%WEB%/%TOPIC%?skin=plain (for the plain view skin that has no header and footer)

---# TWiki Skins

_Skins overlay regular templates with alternate header/footer layouts; topic text is not affected_

---++ Overview

Skins are customized TWikiTemplates files. You can use skins to change the look of a %WIKITOOLNAME% topic, for example, the layout of the header and footer. Rendered text between header and footer does __not__ change. You can also use skins to define an alternate view, like a view optimized for printing.

---++ Defining Skins

Skin files are located in the =twiki/templates= directory and are named with the syntax: ==&lt;scriptname&gt;.&lt;skin&gt;.tmpl==. For example, the *Printable* skin for the =view= template is =view.print.tmpl=.

Use the existing TWikiTemplates (like =view.tmpl=) or skin files as a base for your own skin, name it for example =view.myskin.tmpl=.

---++ Variables in Skins

You can use [[TWikiTemplates#TemplateVariables][template variables]], TWikiVariables, and other predefined variables to compose your skins. Some commonly used variables in skins:

| *Variable:* | *Expanded to:* |
| =%<nop>WIKILOGOURL%= | Link of page logo |
| =%<nop>WIKILOGOIMG%= | Image URL of page logo |
| =%<nop>WIKILOGOALT%= | Alt text of page logo |
| =%<nop>WEBBGCOLOR%= | Web specific background color, defined in the WebPreferences |
| =%<nop>WIKITOOLNAME%= | The name of your TWiki site |
| =%<nop>SCRIPTURL%= | The script URL of TWiki |
| =%<nop>SCRIPTSUFFIX%= | The script suffix, ex: =.pl=, =.cgi= |
| =%<nop>WEB%= | The name of the current web. __Note:__ It is recommended to URL-encode the variable in form actions with =%<nop>INTURLENCODE{"%<nop>WEB%"}%= for proper handling in an internationalized environment |
| =%<nop>TOPIC%= | The name of the current topic. __Note:__ It is recommended to URL-encode the variable in form actions with =%<nop>INTURLENCODE{"%<nop>TOPIC%"}%= for proper handling in an internationalized environment |
| =%<nop>WEBTOPICLIST%= | Common links of current web, defined in the WebPreferences. It includes a [[#GoBox]] |
| =%<nop>TEXT%= | The topic text, e.g. the content that can be edited |
| =%<nop>META{"form"}%= | [[TWikiForms][TWikiForm]], if any |
| =%<nop>META{"attachments"}%= | FileAttachment table |
| =%<nop>META{"parent"}%= | The topic parent |
| =%<nop>EDITTOPIC%= | Edit link |
| =%<nop>REVTITLE%= | The revision title, if any, ex: =(r1.6)= |
| =%<nop>REVINFO%= | Revision info, ex: =r1.6 - 24 Dec 2002 - 08:12 GMT - %WIKIUSERNAME%= |
| =%<nop>WEBCOPYRIGHT%= | Copyright notice, defined in the WebPreferences |
| =%<nop>BROADCASTMESSAGE%= | Broadcast message at the beginning of your view template, can be used to alert users of scheduled downtimes; is set in TWikiPreferences |

#GoBox
---+++ The "Go" Box and Navigation Box

The =%<nop>WEBTOPICLIST%= includes a "Go" box to jump to a topic. The box also understand URLs, e.g. you can type http://www.google.com/ to jump to an external web site. The feature is handy if you build a skin that has a select box of frequently used links, like Intranet home, employee database, sales database and such. A little <nop>JavaScript gets into action on the onSelect method of the select tag to fill the selected URL into the "Go" box field, then submits the form.

Here is an example form that has a select box and the "Go" box for illustration purposes. You need to have <nop>JavaScript enabled for this to work:

<form name="sample" action="%SCRIPTURL%/view%SCRIPTSUFFIX%/%INTURLENCODE{"%WEB%/%TOPIC%"}%">
<table border="3"><tr><td>
<select name="sel" onchange="this.form.topic.value=this.options[this.selectedIndex].value; this.form.submit()">
 <option selected="selected" value="">Navigate...</option>
 <option value="http://www.twiki.org/">Intranet home</option>
 <option value="%MAINWEB%.%WIKIUSERSTOPIC%">Employee index</option>
 <option value="%MAINWEB%.%HOMETOPIC%">%MAINWEB% web</option>
 <option value="%TWIKIWEB%.%HOMETOPIC%">%TWIKIWEB% web</option>
 <option value="http://www.google.com/">Google</option>
 <option value="http://www.yahoo.com/">Yahoo!</option>
 </select>
Bare bones header for demo only
</td></tr><tr><td>
%WEBTOPICLIST%
</td></tr></table>
</form> 

---++ Using Cascading Style Sheets

The regular templates files currently do not use style sheets. Many skin developers choose to use them, it helps in separating style from content.

Example: To use a style sheet for the broadcast message, add this to =view.myskin.tmpl=:

<verbatim>
<style type="text/css">
.broadcastmessage {
	 background: yellow; display:block;
	 border-style:solid;border-width: 2px;border-color:red;
}
.broadcastmessage strong {color: red}
</style>
</verbatim>

Then add a div tag to the =%<nop>BROADCASTMESSAGE%= variable located after the =#PageTop= anchor or after the opening form tag:

<verbatim>
<div class="broadcastmessage"> %BROADCASTMESSAGE% </div>
</verbatim>

---++ Packaging and Publishing Skins

See TWiki:Plugins/SkinPackagingHowTo and TWiki:Plugins/SkinDeveloperFAQ

---++ Activating Skins

A skin can be activated in two ways:

	* Define the =SKIN= Preference variable in TWiki.TWikiPreferences, one of the WebPreferences, or in a user - %WIKIUSERNAME% - topic.
		* =Set SKIN = print=

	* Add =?skin=name= to the URL, for this example:
		* %SCRIPTURL%/view%SCRIPTSUFFIX%/%WEB%/%TOPIC%?skin=print (for the print view skin)
		* %SCRIPTURL%/view%SCRIPTSUFFIX%/%WEB%/%TOPIC%?skin=plain (for the plain view skin that has no header and footer)

The ==?skin=name== URL parameter overrides the SKIN Preference value.
