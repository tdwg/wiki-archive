---+ Wiki name
Your name, usually your first and last name connected without a space.

For example, Tim Berners-Lee's <nop>WikiName is TimBernersLee.

%X% Your name is also a potentially valid WikiWord when used within a topic. However the home pages of registered users on this site are stored in the *%MAINWEB%* web. When you sign your username in a topic, prefix it with =%MAINWEB%.= (including the dot). That is, write ==%MAINWEB%.%WIKINAME%== to link to %MAINWEB%.%WIKINAME%, your personal home page in the %MAINWEB% web. For convenience, your signature is also provided for copying and pasting when editing a topic.

%Y% Though rarely used in common practice, you can use the special ==%<nop>MAINWEB%== [[TWikiVariables][variable]] prefix for user names, for example, ==%<nop>MAINWEB%.%WIKINAME%==.
