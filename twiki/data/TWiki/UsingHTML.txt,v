---++ Using HTML

%STARTINCLUDE%
You can use just about any HTML tag without a problem. You can add HTML if there is no TWiki equivalent, for example, write =&lt;strike&gt;deleted text&lt;/strike&gt;= to get <strike>deleted text</strike>.

%X% There are a few usability and technical considerations to keep in mind:
   * On collaboration pages, it's better *not* to use HTML, but to use [[#TWikiShorthand][TWiki shorthand]] instead - this keeps the text uncluttered and easy to edit.
   * If you use HTML use [[http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/][XHTML 1.0 Transitional]] syntax.
   * %X% Script tags may be filtered out, at the discretion of your TWiki administrator.

Recommendations when pasting HTML from other sources:
   * Copy only text between =&lt;body&gt;= and =&lt;/body&gt;= tags.
   * Remove all empty lines. TWiki inserts =&lt;p /&gt;= paragraph tags on empty lines, which causes problems if done between HTML tags that do not allow paragraph tags, like for example between table tags.
   * Remove leading spaces. TWiki might interpret some text as lists.
   * Do not span a tag over more than one line. TWiki requires that the opening and closing angle brackets - ==&lt;...&gt;== - of an HTML tag are on the same line, or the tag will be broken.
   * In your HTML editing program, save without hard line breaks on text wrap.

%T% TWiki converts shorthand notation to HTML for display. To copy a fully marked-up page, simply view the source in your browser and save the contents. If you need to save HTML frequently, you may want to check out TWiki:Plugins/PublishAddOn.
