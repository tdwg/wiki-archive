@---+ Package =TWiki::UI::Register=

User registration handling.


%TOC%

---++ StaticMethod *register_cgi* <tt>($session)</tt>

=register= command handler.
This method is designed to be
invoked via the =TWiki::UI::run= method.



---++ StaticMethod *passwd_cgi* <tt>($session)</tt>

=passwd= command handler.
This method is designed to be
invoked via the =TWiki::UI::run= method.



---++ StaticMethod *bulkRegister* <tt>($session)</tt>

  Called by ManageCgiScript::bulkRegister (requires authentication) with topic = the page with the entries on it.
   1 Makes sure you are an admin user ;)
   2 Calls TWiki::Data::DelimitedFile (delimiter => '|', content =>textReadFromTopic)
   3 ensures requiredFieldsPresent()
   4 starts a log file
   5 calls registerSingleBulkUser() for each row 
   6 writes output to log file, sets [[TWiki.TOPICPARENT]] back to page with entries on it.
   7 redirects to log file



---++ StaticMethod *registerAndNext* <tt>($session,$tempUserDir)</tt>

This is called when action = register or action = ""

It calls register and either Verify or Finish.

Hopefully we will get workflow integrated and rewrite this to be table driven



---++ StaticMethod *register* <tt>($session)</tt>

This is called through: TWikiRegistration -> RegisterCgiScript -> here

   1 gets rows and fields from the query
   2 calls _validateRegistration() to ensure required fields correct, else OopsException 



---++ StaticMethod *resetPassword* <tt>($session)</tt>

Generates a password. Mails it to them and asks them to change it. Entry
point intended to be called from TWiki::UI::run



---++ StaticMethod *changePassword* <tt>($session)</tt>

Change the user's password and/or email. Details of the user and password
are passed in CGI parameters.

   1 Checks required fields have values
   2 get wikiName and userName from getUserByEitherLoginOrWikiName(username)
   3 check passwords match each other, and that the password is correct, otherwise 'wrongpassword'
   4 TWiki::User::updateUserPassword
   5 'oopschangepasswd'

The NoPasswdUser case is not handled.

An admin user can change other user's passwords.



---++ StaticMethod *verifyEmailAddress* <tt>($session,$tempUserDir)</tt>

This is called: on receipt of the activation password -> RegisterCgiScript -> here
   1 calls _reloadUserContext(activation password)
   2 throws oops if appropriate
   3 calls emailRegistrationConfirmations
   4 still calls 'oopssendmailerr' if a problem, but this is not done uniformly



---++ StaticMethod *finish* <tt></tt>

Presently this is called in RegisterCgiScript directly after a call to verify. The separation is intended for the RegistrationApprovals functionality
   1 calls _reloadUserContext (throws oops if appropriate)
   3 calls createUserTopic()
   4 if using the htpasswdFormatFamily, calls _addUserToPasswordSystem
   5 calls the misnamed RegistrationHandler to set cookies
   6 calls addUserToMapping
   7 writes the logEntry (if wanted :/)
   8 redirects browser to 'oopsregthanks'

reloads the context by code
these two are separate in here to ease the implementation of administrator approval

 generate user entry
 If a password exists (either in Data{PasswordA} or data{CryptPassword}, use it.
 Otherwise generate a random one, and store it back in the user record.
