---# TWiki Installation Guide

_Installation instructions for the TWiki 4.0 production release._

If you are upgrading from a previous version of TWiki, you probably want to read TWikiUpgradeGuide instead.

TWiki should be fine with any web server and OS that meet the [[TWikiSystemRequirements][system requirements]]. The following installation instructions are written for experienced system administrators; please review the AdminSkillsAssumptions before you install TWiki. If you need help, ask a question in the TWiki:Support web or on TWiki:Codev.TWikiIRC (irc.freenode.net, channel #twiki) 

__%H% Hint:__ TWiki:TWiki.InstallingTWiki on TWiki.org has supplemental documentation that help you install TWiki on different platforms, environments and web hosting sites.

#StandardInstallation
---++ Basic Installation

   1 *Download* the TWiki distribution from http://TWiki.org/download.html.
   1 *Make a directory* for the installation and *unpack the distribution* in it.
   1 *Make sure* the user that runs CGI scripts on your system can read and write all files in the distribution.
     %BR% Detailed instructions on file permissions are beyond the scope of this guide, but in general:
      * During installation and configuration, the CGI user needs to be able to read and write _everything_ in the distribution,
      * Once installation and configuration is complete, the CGI user needs write access to everything under the =data= and =pub= directories and to =lib/LocalSite.cfg=. _Everything else_ should be read-only.
      * Everybody else should be denied access to everything, always.
   1 *Make sure* Perl 5 and the Perl CGI library are installed on your system. 
     %BR% The default location of Perl is =/usr/bin/perl=. *If it's somewhere else*, change the path to Perl in the first line of each script in the =twiki/bin= directory.
     %BR% %H% Some systems require a special extension on perl scripts (e.g. =.cgi= or =.pl=). If necessary, rename all files in =twiki/bin=  (i.e. rename =view= to =view.pl= etc). If you do this, make sure you set the =ScriptSuffix= option in [[%SCRIPTURLPATH{"configure"}%][configure]] (Step 6).
   1 *Create the file* =/twiki/bin/LocalLib.cfg=.
     %BR% There is a template for this file in =/twiki/bin/LocalLib.cfg.txt=.
     %BR% The file must contain a setting for =$twikiLibPath=, which must point to the absolute file path of your =twiki/lib= e.g. =/home/httpd/twiki/lib=.
     %BR% %H% If you need to install additional CPAN modules, but can't update the main Perl installation files on the server, you can set =$CPANBASE= to point to your personal CPAN install. Don't forget that the webserver user has to be able to read those files as well.
   1 *Configure the webserver* so you can execute the =bin/configure= script from your browser.
      * Explicit instructions for doing this are beyond the scope of this document, though there is a lot of advice on TWiki.org covering different configurations of webserver. To help you out, there's an example Apache =httpd.conf= file in =twiki_httpd_conf.txt= at the root of the package. This file also contains advice on securing your installation. Additionally, see TWiki:TWiki.ApacheConfigGenerator. There's also a script called =tools/rewriteshebang.pl= to help you in fixing up the shebang lines in your CGI scripts.
   1 Run the =configure= script from your browser, and resolve any errors or warnings it tells you about.
You now have a basic, unauthenticated installation running. At this point you can just point your Web browser at =http://yourdomain.com/twiki/bin/view= and start TWiki-ing away!

#AuthenticationOfUsers
---++ Next Steps
Once you have your TWiki running, you can move on to customise it for your users.
   * *Review TWikiPreferences settings* - read through it and set any additional settings you think you might need (you can click the 'Edit' button near the top to edit the settings in place)
      * %I% It is recommended to *copy* any settings or variables that you want to customize from [[%TWIKIWEB%.TWikiPreferences]] and *paste* them into [[%LOCALSITEPREFS%]]. This will protect your local customizations from being overwritten in later upgrades. See notes at top of [[%TWIKIWEB%.TWikiPreferences]] for more information.
   * *Customize user home pages* - read and change NewUserTemplate.
   * *Enable authentication* - read TWikiUserAuthentication.
   * *Clear admin notes* - some pages are meant to be customized after choice of authentication - check and update these topics (remove notice):
      * ChangePassword
      * ResetPassword
      * ChangeEmailAddress
      * TWikiRegistration fields can be customzied to the needs of your organization
      * %MAINWEB%.TWikiAdminGroup
   * *Enable e-mail notification* - read TWikiSiteTools#WebNotify to get WebChangesAlerts.
   * *Automate update of site statistics* - read TWikiSiteTools#WebStatistics
   * *Automate removal of expired sessions and lease files* - read TWikiScripts#tick_twiki_pl.
   * *Install Plugins* if needed - TWiki:Plugins is an extensive library of Plugins for TWiki, that enhance functionality in a huge number of ways. A few Plugins are pre-installed in the TWiki distribution. Installation instructions are included in Plugins you download from TWiki:Plugins.PluginPackage on TWiki.org.
   * *Review known issues* - visit TWiki:Codev.KnownIssuesOfTWiki04x00x00 and fix issues that apply to you.

---++ Troubleshooting
   * The first step is to re-run the =configure= script and make sure you have resolved all errors, and are happy that you understand any warnings.
   * TWiki:TWiki.InstallingTWiki on TWiki.org has supplemental documentation that help you install TWiki on different platforms, environments and web hosting sites.
   * If you need help, ask a question in the TWiki:Support web or on TWiki:Codev.TWikiIRC (irc.freenode.net, channel #twiki)

These installation steps are based on the *Apache* web server on *Linux*. TWiki runs on other web servers and Unix systems, and should be fine with any web server and OS that meet the [[TWikiSystemRequirements][system requirements]].  Official documentation for platforms other than Linux is somewhat limited, so _please check_ the topics listed below, they include some important tips for HP-UX, Solaris, OS/390, and many other platforms.

	* For Unix or Linux, check TWiki:Codev/TWikiOnUnix (install your own RCS, =diff= and =grep= tools if in doubt!) and TWiki:Codev/TWikiOnLinux.
	* For Windows, check the WindowsInstallCookbook. 
	* For <nop>MacOS X, check TWiki:Codev/TWikiOnMacOSX. 
	* To install TWiki on <nop>SourceForge, for use on a software development project, read TWiki:Codev/TWikiOnSourceForge
	* For other platforms, see TWiki:Codev/TWikiOn, and search the TWiki:Codev and TWiki:Support webs for other installation notes.
	* If you need help, ask a question in the TWiki:Support web

---++ Standard Installation

Download the TWiki 01-Sep-2004 distribution in Unix ZIP format from http://TWiki.org/download.html. Please review the AdminSkillsAssumptions before you install TWiki.

---+++ Step 1: Create &amp; Configure the Directories

%X% *NOTE:* _If you don't have access to your Web server configuration files - for example, if you're installing on an ISP-hosted account, or you don't have administrator privileges on your intranet server - use the [[#StepOneB][alternative Step 1]] instead._

	* Create directory =/home/httpd/twiki= and [[http://www.info-zip.org/pub/infozip/UnZip.html][unzip]] the TWiki distribution into this directory.
	* The =twiki/bin= directory of TWiki must be set as a cgi-bin directory. Add =/home/httpd/twiki/bin= to file =httpd.conf= (typcially located in =/etc/httpd/=) with only =ExecCGI= option.
	* The =twiki/pub= directory of TWiki must be set so that it is visible as a URL. Add =/home/httpd/twiki= to file =httpd.conf= with normal access options (copy from =/home/httpd/html= ).
	* Now add =ScriptAlias= for =/twiki/bin= and =Alias= for =/twiki= to file =httpd.conf= .
	  <br /> %X% *NOTE:* The =ScriptAlias= __must__ come before the =Alias=, otherwise, Apache will fail to correctly set up =/twiki/bin/=, by treating it as just another subdirectory of the =/twiki/= alias.
	* The =twiki/data= and =twiki/templates= directories should be set so that they are *not* visible as URLs. Add them to =httpd.conf= with =deny from all=.

<blockquote style="background-color:#F5F5F5">
*Example =httpd.conf= entries:*
 <pre> Script<nop>Alias /twiki/bin/ "/home/httpd/twiki/bin/"
 Alias /twiki/ "/home/httpd/twiki/"
 &lt;Directory "/home/httpd/twiki/bin"&gt;
	 Options +ExecCGI
	 Set<nop>Handler cgi-script
	 Allow from all
 &lt;/Directory&gt;
 &lt;Directory "/home/httpd/twiki/pub"&gt;

</blockquote>

	* Restart Apache by =service httpd restart= (or as appropriate to your flavor of UNIX or Linux).
	* Test that the =twiki/bin= directory is CGI-enabled by trying visiting it in your browser:
		* Enter the URL for the =bin= directory, =http://yourdomain.com/twiki/bin/=
		* Your settings are OK if you get a message like ="Forbidden. You don't have permission to access /twiki/bin/ on this server"=.
		* Settings are NOT correct if you get something like ="Index of /twiki/bin"= - recheck your =httpd.conf= file. 

	* _Go directly to [[#StepTwo][Step 2]]..._

#StepOneB		  
---++++ Aletrnative Step 1: Create &amp; Configure the Directories for Non-Root Accounts

To install TWiki on a system where you don't have Unix/Linux root (administrator) privileges, for example, on a hosted Web account or an intranet server administered by someone else: 

	* Download and unzip TWiki on your local PC
	* Using the table below, create a directory structure on your host server
	* Upload the TWiki files by FTP (transfer as _text_ except for the image files in =pub=)
<blockquote>
| *TWiki dir:* | *What it is:* | *Where to copy:* | *Example:* |
| =twiki= | start-up pages | root TWiki dir | =/home/smith/twiki/= |
| =twiki/bin= | CGI bin | CGI-enabled dir | =/home/smith/twiki/bin= |
| =twiki/lib= | library files | same level as =twiki/bin= | =/home/smith/twiki/lib= |
| =twiki/pub= | public files | htdoc enabled dir | =/home/smith/twiki/pub= |
| =twiki/data= | topic data | dir secure from public access | =/home/smith/twiki/data= |
| =twiki/templates= | web templates | dir secure from public access | =/home/smith/twiki/templates= |
</blockquote>

__Note:__ Don't worry if you are not able to put the =twiki/lib= directory at the same level as the =twiki/bin= directory (e.g. because CGI =bin= directories can't be under your home directory and you don't have root access). You can create this directory elsewhere and configure the =/twiki/bin/setlib.cfg= file (done in Step 3)

#StepTwo
---+++ Step 2: Set File Permissions

	* Make sure Perl 5 and the Perl CGI library are installed on your system. The default location of Perl is =/usr/bin/perl=. If it's elsewhere, change the path to Perl in the first line of each script in the =twiki/bin= directory, or create a symbolic link from =/usr/bin/perl=.
		* *IMPORTANT:*
			* On ISP-hosted accounts (and some intranet servers), Perl CGI scripts may require a =.cgi= extension to run. Some systems need =.pl=, the regular Perl extension. Rename all =twiki/bin= scripts if necessary.
			* Alternatively, you might try creating a file =twiki/bin/.htaccess= that contains the single line =SetHandler cgi-script=, which tells Apache to treat all files in this directory as CGI scripts.
	* Set the file permission of all Perl scripts in the =twiki/bin= directory as executable to =-rwxr-xr-x= (755).
	* To be able to edit the Perl scripts and =.tmpl= files it is necessary to =chown= and =chgrp -R twiki= so all the files have the owner you want.
	* %H% This Guide assumes user =nobody= ownership for all files manipulated by the CGI scripts (executed by the Web server), and user =twiki= for all other files. You can: 
		* replace =nobody= with another user if your server executes scripts under a different name (ex: default for Debian is =www-data=).
			* %T% *HINT:* Run the =testenv= script from your browser: =http://yourdomain.com/twiki/bin/testenv=. It will show you the user name of the CGI scripts, a table listing all CGI environment variables, and a test of your =twiki/lib/TWiki.cfg= configuration file (you'll configure that in a minute).
		* replace user =twiki= with your own username
	* Set permissions manually.
		* Set the permission of all *files* below =twiki/data= so that they are writable by user =nobody=. A simple way is to =chmod= them to =-rw-rw-r--= (664) and to =chown= them to =nobody=.
		* Set the permission of the =twiki/data= *directory* and its *subdirectories* so that files in there are writable by user =nobody=. A simple way is to chmod them to =drwxrwxr-x= (775) and to =chown= them to =nobody=.
		* Set the permission of the =twiki/pub= directory and all its subdirectories so that files in there are writable by user =nobody=. A simple way is to =chmod= them to =drwxrwxr-x= (775) and to =chown= them to =nobody=.
		* %H% The =twiki/data/*/*.txt,v= RCS repository files in the installation package are locked by user =nobody=. If your CGI scripts are __not__ running as user =nobody=, it's not possible to check in files (you'll see that the revision number won't increase after saving a topic). In this case, you need to unlock all repository files (check the RCS man pages) and lock them with a different user, such as =www-data=, or delete them all - new files will be automatically created the first time each topic is edited. You have two options to change ownership of the RCS lock user:
			* Run the =testenv= script from your browser; in the %BROWN% *Fix* %ENDCOLOR% line you can <u>relock</u> all the rcs files *(recommended)*
			* Alternatively, run this in your shell: %BR%
			  =cd twiki/data= %BR%
			  =find . -name *,v -exec perl -pi~ -e '$. &lt;=<nop> 10 && s/nobody:/www-data:/ ' {} \;= %BR%
			  This will create =*,v~= backup files which you should remove after verification: %BR%
			  =find . -name *,v~ -exec rm -f {} \;=


---+++ Step 3: Edit the Configuration Files

	* Edit the file =/twiki/bin/setlib.cfg=
		* Set =$twikiLibPath= to the absolute file path of your =/twiki/lib= as seen by the web server.
		* %X% __Attention:__ Do *not* leave it as a relative ="../lib"= path or Plugins might fail to initialize properly
		* You can also edit =$localPerlLibPath= if you are not root and need to install additional CPAN modules, but can't update the main Perl installation files on the server.  Just set this variable to the full pathname to your local lib directory, typically under your home directory. 
		* %X% __Attention:__ If you are running TWiki on Apache 2.0 on Unix you might experience cgi scripts to hang forever. This is a known Apache 2.0 bug. See details and woraround in the =setlib.cfg= file.
	* Edit the file =twiki/lib/TWiki.cfg=, setting the variables to your needs.
		* Set the file extension in the =$scriptSuffix= variable to =cgi= or =pl= if required.
		* RCS - revision control system to store revision of topics and attachments.  You can use RCS executables or a version of RCS written in Perl, note that as the time of writing (Apr 2002) the Perl version has not been widely tested, so if you want to put up a live site the RCS executables are recommended. 
			* Set <code>$storeTopicImpl = "RcsWrap";</code> for the RCS executables and make sure RCS is installed. Set =$rcsDir= in =twiki/lib/TWiki.cfg= to match the location of your RCS binaries. You can check this by issuing the command =rcs= at the prompt, it should result in something like ="rcs: no input file"=.  
				* Check that you have GNU =diff=, by typing =diff -v= - an error indicates you have a non-GNU diff, so install the GNU =diffutils= package and make sure that =diff= is on the PATH used by TWiki (see =$safeEnvPath= in the =TWiki.cfg= file).
			* Set <code>$storeTopicImpl = "RcsLite";</code> for the Perl based RCS
	* *Security issue:* Directories =twiki/data= , =twiki/templates= and all their subdirectories should be set so that they are __not__ visible through URLs. (Alternatively, move the directories to a place where they are not visible, and change the variables in =twiki/lib/TWiki.cfg= accordingly)
	* Test your settings by running the =testenv= script from your browser: =http://yourdomain.com/twiki/bin/testenv=. Check if your =twiki/lib/TWiki.cfg= configuration file settings are correct.


---+++ Step 4: Internationalisation Setup (Optional)

By default, TWiki is configured to support US ASCII letters (no accents) in WikiWords, and ISO-8859-1 (Western European) characters in page contents.  If that's OK for you, skip this step.

If your Wiki will be used by non-English speakers, TWiki can be configured for Internationalisation ('I' followed by 18 letters, then 'N', or _I18N_).  Specifically, TWiki will support suitable accented characters in WikiWords (as well as languages such as Japanese or Chinese in which WikiWords do not apply), and will support virtually any character set in the contents of pages.  __NOTE:__ TWiki does not currently support UTF-8, so you are advised *not* to use this - however, improved UTF-8 support is under development, see TWiki:Codev/ProposedUTF8SupportForI18N.

To configure internationalisation suppport:
	1 Edit the =TWiki.cfg= file's Internationalisation section to set the =$useLocale= parameter to =1=.  TWiki will now use the I18N parameters set in the rest of this section.
	1 Type the Unix/Linux command =locale -a= to find a suitable 'locale' for your use of TWiki.  A locale that includes a dot followed by a character set is recommended, e.g. =pl_PL.ISO-8859-2= for Poland.  Consult your system administrator if you are not sure which locale to use.
	1 In =TWiki.cfg=, set the =$siteLocale= parameter to your chosen locale, e.g. =pl_PL.ISO-8859-2= for Poland. 
	1 Check your setup using =testenv= (download the latest =testenv= from TWiki:Support/SupportGuidelines if possible) - this provides some diagnostics for I18N setup, and in particular checks that your locale can be used successfully.
	1 _(For upgrade of TWiki I18N sites only:)_ If you were using TWiki:Codev.TWikiRelease01Feb2003 support for I18N, and are using Internet Explorer or Opera, you should re-configure your browser so that it sends URLs encoded with UTF-8 (supported since TWiki:Codev.TWikiRelease01Sep2004).  If you are doing a new installation of TWiki, you can ignore this step - no browser reconfiguration is needed for TWiki Release 01-Sep-2004).
		* Internet Explorer 5.0 or higher: in  _Tools | Options | Advanced_, check 'always send URLs as UTF-8', then close all IE windows and restart IE. 
		* Opera 6.x or higher: in _Preferences | Network | International Web Addresses_, check 'encode all addresses with UTF-8'.
		* __NOTE:__ This does not mean that TWiki supports UTF-8 as a site character set.
	1 Try out your TWiki by creating pages in the Sandbox web that use international characters in WikiWords and checking that searching, WebIndex, Ref-By and other features are working OK.

---++++ Trouble with I18N? 

If international characters in WikiWords do not seem to work, and you are on Perl 5.6 or higher, you may need to set the =TWiki.cfg= parameter =$localeRegexes= to 0 - this disables some features but enables TWiki to work even if your system has locales that do not work.  Then, set the =$upperNational= and =$lowerNational= parameters to the valid upper and lower case accented letters for your locale. 
	* __NOTE:__ You will need to do the above workaround for Windows based servers (whether using Cygwin or <nop>ActiveState Perl), since Perl locales are not working on Windows as of Feb 2004.

If international characters in WikiWords aren't working, and you are on Perl 5.005 with working locales, keep =$useLocale= set to 1 and set =$localeRegexes= to 0, then set =$upperNational= and =$lowerNational= - if =testenv= generates the lists of characters for you, your locales are working so there is no need to set =$localeRegexes= to 0 in this case.  See the comments in =TWiki.cfg= for more information.

---+++ Step 5: Configure Site-Wide Email Preferences

	* Edit the TWikiPreferences topic in the %TWIKIWEB% web (by pointing your browser to <nop>http://yourdomain.com/twiki/bin/view/%TWIKIWEB%/TWikiPreferences) to set the =WIKIWEBMASTER= email address, and other email settings required for registration and WebChangesAlert to work:
		* =WIKIWEBMASTER= should be set to the email address of the TWiki administrator
		* =SMTPMAILHOST= is typically set on Windows or other non-Unix/Linux systems, where =sendmail= or similar is not available.  When this is set and the Perl module ==Net::SMTP== is installed, TWiki will connect to this SMTP server (e.g. =mail.yourdomain.com=) to send email for user registration and WebChangesAlerts.  If you do have a sendmail-type program, leave =SMTPMAILHOST= unset so that the external sendmail program is used instead (defined by ==$mailProgram== in ==TWiki.cfg==).
		* =SMTPSENDERHOST= is optional, and set to the domain name sending the email (e.g. =twiki.yourdomain.com=). For use where the SMTP server requires that you identify the TWiki server sending mail. If not set, ==Net::SMTP== will guess it for you. 
	* You may want to set up other TWikiPreferences later on.
	* To enable the WebChangesAlerts (email notifications) you need to read about cron in the topic TWiki.TWikiSiteTools.

---+++ Step 6: Finish Up from Your Browser

	* Point your Web browser at =http://yourdomain.com/twiki/bin/view= and start TWiki-ing away!
		* %T% Or, point to =http://yourdomain.com/twiki/= to get the pre-TWiki =index.html= page, with a link to the =view= script. Customize this page if you want a public intro screen with a login link, instead of immediately calling up the .htaccess login dialog by going directly to =view=.
	* Edit the WebPreferences topic in each web, if necessary: set individual =WEBCOPYRIGHT= messages, and other preferences.
	* Enable email notification of topic changes - TWikiSiteTools has more. 
	* Edit the WebNotify topic in all webs and add the users you want to notify.
	* Add the TWiki:Main/PoweredByTWikiLogo to your [[%MAINWEB%.%HOMETOPIC%]] topic.
	* You can add new =%<nop>VARIABLES%=. Define site-level variables in the TWikiPreferences topic. See also: TWikiVariables.

That's it for the standard installation of TWiki. Read on for server-level customization options.

---++ Additional Server-Level Options

With your new TWiki installation up and running, you can manage most aspects of your site from the browser interface. Only a few functions require access to the server file system, via Telnet or FTP. You can make these server-level changes during installation, and at any time afterwards.
d35 22
a56 29
---+++ Enabling Authentication of Users

	* If TWiki is installed on a non-authenticated server - not using SSL - and you'd like to authenticate users:
		1. *Rename* file =.htaccess.txt= in the =twiki/bin= directory to =.htaccess= and change it to your needs. The comment at the top of the file explains what need to be done, basically replace =!FILE_path_to_TWiki!= and =!URL_path_to_TWiki!= with paths specific to your installation. _For the details of how this file works, consult the HTTP server documentation (for Apache server: <a href="http://www.apache.org/docs/mod/directives.html">[1]</a>, <a href="http://systems.mcs.kent.edu/info/web_help/htaccess/">[2]</a>)_.
			* %X% *NOTE:* If you had to add a =.cgi= or =.pl= file extension to the =bin= scripts, make sure to do the same for =edit=, =view=, =preview=, and all the other script names in =.htaccess=. 
			* %H% The browser should ask for login name and password when you click on the <u>Edit</u> link. In case =.htaccess= does not have the desired effect, you need to enable it: Add "AllowOverride All" to the Directory <a href=http://httpd.apache.org/docs/mod/core.html#directory>[3]</a> section of =access.conf= for your =twiki/bin= directory. 
				* *This applies only if you have root access:* on hosted accounts, you shouldn't have this problem - otherwise, email tech support.
			* %X% *NOTE:* In the TWiki distribution package, the =twiki/data/.htpasswd.txt= file contains several TWiki core team user accounts and a guest user account. You probably want to remove those accounts by deleting the entries in =.htpasswd=. Do not remove the guest user if you want to allow guest logins.
		1. TWiki now supports several Password file format/encoding methods for Apache. Once you know what method is used by your Appache server, you can configure TWiki to create compatible .htpasswd entries by editing the =$htpasswdFormatFamily=, =$htpasswdEncoding= and =$htpasswdFilename= in the TWiki.cfg file. The supported options are htpasswd:plain, htpasswd:crypt, htpasswd:sha1, htdigest:md5
		1. *Copy* the TWikiRegistrationPub topic to TWikiRegistration, overwriting old version of <nop>TWikiRegistration. Do that by either editing the topics in the%TWIKIWEB% web, or by renaming the =.txt= and =.txt,v= files in the =twiki/data/%TWIKIWEB%= directory.
	* Customization:
		* You can customize the registration form by deleting or adding input tags. The =name=""= parameter of the input tags must start with: ="Twk0..."= (if this is an optional entry), or ="Twk1..."= (if this is a required entry). This ensures that the fields are carried over into the user home page correctly.
		* You can customize the default user home page in NewUserTemplate. The same variables get expanded as in the [[TWikiTemplates#Template_Topics][template topics]]
	* Register yourself in the TWikiRegistration topic.
		* %X% *NOTE:* When a user registers, a new line with the username and encrypted password is added to the =data/.htpasswd= file. The =.htpasswd= file that comes with the TWiki installation includes user accounts for TWiki core team members that are used for testing on TWiki.org. You can edit the file and delete those lines.
	* Create a new topic to check if authentication works.
	* Edit the %MAINWEB%.TWikiAdminGroup topic in the TWiki:%MAINWEB% web to include users with system administrator status.
	* Edit the TWikiPreferences topic in the TWiki:%TWIKIWEB% web to set access privileges.
	* Edit the WebPreferences topic in each web, if necessary: set access priviliges.

---+++ WYSIWYG Editor

At this time, TWiki does not ship with an "what you see is what you get" editor. TWiki:Codev/IntegrateHtmlAreaEditor describes how to integrate an HTML editor.

%X% *NOTE:* User home topics are located in the %WIKITOOLNAME%.%MAINWEB% web - don't try to move them or create them in other webs. From any other web, user signatures have to point to %WIKITOOLNAME%.%MAINWEB% web, using a =%MAINWEB%.<nop>UserName= or =%<nop>MAINWEB%.<nop>UserName= format. (The =%<nop>MAINWEB%= variable is an advantage if you ever change the %MAINWEB% web name, but the standard =%MAINWEB%.<nop>UserName= is easier for users to enter, which is the bottom line!)

---# TWiki Installation Guide

_Installation instructions for the TWiki 01-Feb-2003 production release._

_If you are reading this on your own TWiki installation, please get the latest installation guide (TWiki:TWiki.TWikiInstallationGuide), as this often has important updates to resolve installation issues._

These installation steps are based on the *Apache* web server on *Linux*. TWiki runs on other web servers and Unix systems, and should be fine with any web server and OS that meet the [[TWikiSystemRequirements][system requirements]].  Official documentation for platforms other than Linux is somewhat limited, so _please check_ the topics listed below, they include some important tips for HP-UX, Solaris, OS/390, and many other platforms.

	* For Unix or Linux, check TWiki:Codev/TWikiOnUnix (install your own RCS, =diff= and =grep= tools if in doubt!) and TWiki:Codev/TWikiOnLinux.
	* For Windows, check the WindowsInstallCookbook. 
	* For <nop>MacOS X, check TWiki:Codev/TWikiOnMacOSX. 
	* To install TWiki on <nop>SourceForge, for use on a software development project, read TWiki:Codev/TWikiOnSourceForge
	* For other platforms, see TWiki:Codev/TWikiOn, and search the TWiki:Codev and TWiki:Support webs for other installation notes.
	* If you need __really urgent__ help, try the TWiki:Codev/TWikiIRC channel.

#StandardInstallation
---++ Standard Installation

Request and download the TWiki 01-Feb-2003 distribution in Unix ZIP format from http://TWiki.org/download.html. Please review the AdminSkillsAssumptions before you install TWiki.

---+++ Step 1: Create &amp; Configure the Directories

%X% *NOTE:* _If you don't have access to your Web server configuration files - for example, if you're installing on an ISP-hosted account, or you don't have administrator privileges on your intranet server - use the [[#StepOneB][alternative Step 1]] instead._

	* Create directory =/home/httpd/twiki= and [[http://www.info-zip.org/pub/infozip/UnZip.html][unzip]] the TWiki distribution into this directory.
	* The =twiki/bin= directory of TWiki must be set as a cgi-bin directory. Add =/home/httpd/twiki/bin= to file =httpd.conf= (typcially located in =/etc/httpd/=) with only =ExecCGI= option.
	* The =twiki/pub= directory of TWiki must be set so that it is visible as a URL. Add =/home/httpd/twiki= to file =httpd.conf= with normal access options (copy from =/home/httpd/html= ).
	* Now add =ScriptAlias= for =/twiki/bin= and =Alias= for =/twiki= to file =httpd.conf= .
	  <br /> %X% *NOTE:* The =ScriptAlias= __must__ come before the =Alias=, otherwise, Apache will fail to correctly set up =/twiki/bin/=, by treating it as just another subdirectory of the =/twiki/= alias.
	* The =twiki/data= and =twiki/templates= directories should be set so that they are *not* visible as URLs. Add them to =httpd.conf= with =deny from all=.

<blockquote style="background-color:#F5F5F5">
*Example =httpd.conf= entries:*
 <pre> Script<nop>Alias /twiki/bin/ "/home/httpd/twiki/bin/"
 Alias /twiki/ "/home/httpd/twiki/"
 &lt;Directory "/home/httpd/twiki/bin"&gt;
	 Options +ExecCGI
	 Set<nop>Handler cgi-script
	 Allow from all
 &lt;/Directory&gt;
 &lt;Directory "/home/httpd/twiki/pub"&gt;
	 Options Follow<nop>Sym<nop>Links +Includes
	 Allow<nop>Override None
	 Allow from all
 &lt;/Directory&gt;
 &lt;Directory "/home/httpd/twiki/data"&gt;
	 deny from all
 &lt;/Directory&gt;
 &lt;Directory "/home/httpd/twiki/templates"&gt;
	 deny from all
 &lt;/Directory&gt;</pre>
</blockquote>

	* Restart Apache by =/etc/rc.d/rc5.d/S85httpd restart= .
	* Test that the =twiki/bin= directory is CGI-enabled by trying visiting it in your browser:
		* Enter the URL for the =bin= directory, =http://yourdomain.com/twiki/bin/=.
		* Your settings are OK if you get a message like ="Forbidden. You don't have permission to access /twiki/bin/ on this server"=.
		* Settings are NOT correct if you get something like ="Index of /twiki/bin"= - recheck your =httpd.conf= file. 

	* _Go directly to [[#StepTwo][Step 2]]..._

#StepOneB		  
---++++ Step 1 for Non-Root Accounts

To install TWiki on a system where you don't have Unix/Linux root (administrator) privileges, for example, on a hosted Web account or an intranet server administered by someone else: 

	* Download and unzip TWiki on your local PC
	* Using the table below, create a directory structure on your host server
	* Upload the TWiki files by FTP (transfer as _text_ except for the image files in =pub=)
<blockquote>
| *TWiki dir:* | *What it is:* | *Where to copy:* | *Example:* |
| =twiki= | start-up pages | root TWiki dir | =/home/smith/twiki/= |
| =twiki/bin= | CGI bin | CGI-enabled dir | =/home/smith/twiki/bin= |
| =twiki/lib= | library files | same level as =twiki/bin= | =/home/smith/twiki/lib= |
| =twiki/pub= | public files | htdoc enabled dir | =/home/smith/twiki/pub= |
| =twiki/data= | topic data | dir secure from public access | =/home/smith/twiki/data= |
| =twiki/templates= | web templates | dir secure from public access | =/home/smith/twiki/templates= |
</blockquote>

If you are not able to create the =twiki/lib= directory at the same level as the =twiki/bin= directory (e.g. because CGI =bin= directories can't be under your home directory and you don't have root access), you can create this directory elsewhere and edit the =setlib.cfg= file in the =bin= directory:

<pre>
	 # -------------- Change these settings if required

	 $twikiLibPath = <font color="red">'/some/other/path/lib'</font>;	# Path to lib directory containing TWiki.pm

</pre>

You can also edit =$localPerlLibPath= in the =setlib.cfg= file if you are not root and need to install additional CPAN modules, but can't update the main Perl installation files on the server.  Just set this variable to the full pathname to your local lib directory, typically under your home directory. 

#StepTwo
---+++ Step 2: Set File Permissions

	* Make sure Perl 5 and the Perl CGI library are installed on your system. The default location of Perl is =/usr/bin/perl=. If it's elsewhere, change the path to Perl in the first line of each script in the =twiki/bin= directory, or create a symbolic link from =/usr/bin/perl=.
		* *IMPORTANT:* On ISP-hosted accounts (and some intranet servers), Perl CGI scripts may require a =.cgi= extension to run. Some systems need =.pl=, the regular Perl extension. Rename all =twiki/bin= scripts if necessary.
	* Set the file permission of all Perl scripts in the =twiki/bin= directory as executable to =-rwxr-xr-x= (755).
	* To be able to edit the Perl scripts and =.tmpl= files it is necessary to =chown= and =chgrp -R twiki= so all the files have the owner you want.
	* %H% This Guide assumes user =nobody= ownership for all files manipulated by the CGI scripts (executed by the Web server), and user =twiki= for all other files. You can: 
		* replace =nobody= with another user if your server executes scripts under a different name (ex: default for Debian is =www-data=).
			* %T% *HINT:* Run the =testenv= script from your browser: =http://yourdomain.com/twiki/bin/testenv=. It will show you the user name of the CGI scripts, a table listing all CGI environment variables, and a test of your =twiki/lib/TWiki.cfg= configuration file (you'll configure that in a minute).
		* replace user =twiki= with your own username
	* Set the permission of all files below =twiki/data= so that they are writable by user =nobody=. A simple way is to =chmod= them to =-rw-rw-r--= (664) and to =chown= them to =nobody=.
	* Set the permission of the =twiki/data= directory and its subdirectories so that files in there are writable by user =nobody=. A simple way is to chmod them to =drwxrwxr-x= (775) and to =chown= them to =nobody=.
	* Set the permission of the =twiki/pub= directory and all its subdirectories so that files in there are writable by user =nobody=. A simple way is to =chmod= them to =drwxrwxr-x= (775) and to =chown= them to =nobody=.
	* %H% The =twiki/data/*/*.txt,v= RCS repository files in the installation package are locked by user =nobody=. If your CGI scripts are __not__ running as user =nobody=, it's not possible to check in files (you'll see that the revision number won't increase after saving a topic). In this case, you need to unlock all repository files (check the RCS man pages) and lock them with a different user, such as =www-data=, or delete them all - new files will be automatically created the first time each topic is edited. A simple way to change ownership is with a search-and-replace in all files; for example, using Perl (type this carefully!):
<blockquote style="background-color:#F5F5F5">
<pre>
cd twiki/data
perl -pi~ -e 'NR <= 10 && s/nobody:/www-data:/ ' */*,v

</pre>
</blockquote>

---+++ Step 3: Set the Main Configuration File

	* Edit the file =twiki/lib/TWiki.cfg=, setting the variables to your needs.
		* Set the file extension in the =$scriptSuffix= variable to =cgi= or =pl= if required.
		* RCS - revision control system to store revision of topics and attachments.  You can use RCS executables or a version of RCS written in Perl, note that as the time of writing (Apr 2002) the Perl version has not been widely tested, so if you want to put up a live site the RCS executables are recommended. 
			* Set <code>$storeTopicImpl = "RcsWrap";</code> for the RCS executables and make sure RCS is installed. Set =$rcsDir= in =twiki/lib/TWiki.cfg= to match the location of your RCS binaries. You can check this by issuing the command =rcs= at the prompt, it should result in something like ="rcs: no input file"=.  
				* Check that you have GNU =diff=, by typing =diff -v= - an error indicates you have a non-GNU diff, so install the GNU =diffutils= package and make sure that =diff= is on the PATH used by TWiki (see =$safeEnvPath= in the =TWiki.cfg= file).
			* Set <code>$storeTopicImpl = "RcsLite";</code> for the Perl based RCS
	* *Security issue:* Directories =twiki/data= , =twiki/templates= and all their subdirectories should be set so that they are __not__ visible through URLs. (Alternatively, move the directories to a place where they are not visible, and change the variables in =twiki/lib/TWiki.cfg= accordingly)
	* Test your settings by running the =testenv= script from your browser: =http://yourdomain.com/twiki/bin/testenv=. Check if your =twiki/lib/TWiki.cfg= configuration file settings are correct.


---+++ Step 4: Configure Site-Wide Email Preferences

	* Edit the TWikiPreferences topic in the %TWIKIWEB% web (by pointing your browser to <nop>http://yourdomain.com/twiki/bin/view/%TWIKIWEB%/TWikiPreferences) to set the =WIKIWEBMASTER= email address, and other email settings required for registration and WebChangesAlert to work:
		* =WIKIWEBMASTER= should be set to the email address of the TWiki administrator
		* =SMTPMAILHOST= is typically set on Windows or other non-Unix/Linux systems, where =sendmail= or similar is not available.  When this is set and the Perl module ==Net::SMTP== is installed, TWiki will connect to this SMTP server (e.g. =mail.yourdomain.com=) to send email for user registration and WebChangesAlerts.  If you do have a sendmail-type program, leave =SMTPMAILHOST= unset so that the external sendmail program is used instead (defined by ==$mailProgram== in ==TWiki.cfg==).
		* =SMTPSENDERHOST= is optional, and set to the domain name sending the email (e.g. =twiki.yourdomain.com=). For use where the SMTP server requires that you identify the TWiki server sending mail. If not set, ==Net::SMTP== will guess it for you. 
	* You may want to set up other TWikiPreferences later on.
	* To enable the WebChangesAlerts (email notifications) you need to read about cron in the topic TWiki.TWikiSiteTools.

---+++ Step 5: Finish Up from Your Browser

	* Point your Web browser at =http://yourdomain.com/twiki/bin/view= and start TWiki-ing away!
		* %T% Or, point to =http://yourdomain.com/twiki/= to get the pre-TWiki =index.html= page, with a link to the =view= script. Customize this page if you want a public intro screen with a login link, instead of immediately calling up the .htaccess login dialog by going directly to =view=.
	* Edit the WebPreferences topic in each web, if necessary: set individual =WEBCOPYRIGHT= messages, and other preferences.
	* Enable email notification of topic changes, TWikiSiteTools has more. 
	* Edit the WebNotify topic in all webs and add the users you want to notify.
	* Add the TWiki:Main/PoweredByTWikiLogo to your [[%MAINWEB%.%HOMETOPIC%]] topic.
	* You can add new =%<nop>VARIABLES%=. Define site-level variables in the TWikiPreferences topic. See also: TWikiVariables.

That's it for the standard virgin installation of TWiki. Read on for server-level customization options.

---++ Additional Server-Level Options

With your new TWiki installation up and running, you can manage most aspects of your site from the browser interface. Only a few functions require access to the server file system, via Telnet or FTP. You can make these server-level changes during installation, and at any time afterwards.

#AuthenticationOfUsers
---+++ Enabling Authentication of Users

	* If TWiki is installed on a non-authenticated server - not using SSL - and you'd like to authenticate users:
		1. *Rename* file =.htaccess.txt= in the =twiki/bin= directory to =.htaccess= and change it to your needs. For details, consult the HTTP server documentation (for Apache server: <a href="http://www.apache.org/docs/mod/directives.html">[1]</a>, <a href="http://systems.mcs.kent.edu/info/web_help/htaccess/">[2]</a>). In particular, the following <font color="red">red</font> part needs to be configured correctly: <br />
		 =Redirect <font color="red">/urlpathto/twiki/index.html</font> http<nop>://<font color="red">yourdomain.com/urlpathto/twiki/bin/</font>view= <br>
		  =AuthUserFile <font color="red">/filepathto/twiki/data/</font>.htpasswd= <br />
		  =ErrorDocument 401 <font color="red">/urlpathto/twiki/bin/</font>oops/TWiki/TWikiRegistration?template=oopsauth=
			* %X% *NOTE:* If you had to add a =.cgi= or =.pl= file extension to the =bin= scripts, make sure to do the same for =edit=, =view=, =preview=, and all the other script names in =.htaccess=. 
			* %H% The browser should ask for login name and password when you click on the <u>Edit</u> link. In case =.htaccess= does not have the desired effect, you need to enable it: Add "AllowOverride All" to the Directory <a href=http://httpd.apache.org/docs/mod/core.html#directory>[3]</a> section of =access.conf= for your =twiki/bin= directory. 
				* *This applies only if you have root access:* on hosted accounts, you shouldn't have this problem - otherwise, email tech support.
			* %X% *NOTE:* In the TWiki distribution package, the =twiki/data/.htpasswd.txt= file contains several TWiki core team user accounts and a guest user account. You probably want to remove those accounts by deleting the entries in =.htpasswd=. Do not remove the guest user if you want to allow guest logins.
		1. *Copy* the TWikiRegistrationPub topic to TWikiRegistration, overwriting old version of <nop>TWikiRegistration. Do that by either editing the topics in the%TWIKIWEB% web, or by renaming the =.txt= and =.txt,v= files in the =twiki/data/%TWIKIWEB%= directory.
	* Customization:
		* You can customize the registration form by deleting or adding input tags. The =name=""= parameter of the input tags must start with: ="Twk0..."= (if this is an optional entry), or ="Twk1..."= (if this is a required entry). This ensures that the fields are carried over into the user home page correctly.
		* You can customize the default user home page in NewUserTemplate.
	* Register yourself in the TWikiRegistration topic.
		* %X% *NOTE:* When a user registers, a new line with the username and encrypted password is added to the =data/.htpasswd= file. The =.htpasswd= file that comes with the TWiki installation includes user accounts for TWiki core team members that are used for testing on TWiki.org. You can edit the file and delete those lines.
	* Create a new topic to check if authentication works.
	* Edit the %MAINWEB%.TWikiAdminGroup topic in the TWiki:%MAINWEB% web to include users with system administrator status.
	* Edit the TWikiPreferences topic in the TWiki:%TWIKIWEB% web to set access privileges.
	* Edit the WebPreferences topic in each web, if necessary: set access priviliges.

That's it for a basic new web set-up!

Optionally, you can also:
	* Create custom web-specific templates in a new =twiki/templates/Someweb= directory (otherwise, templates are inherited from =twiki/templates=).
	* Add TWikiForms for form-based page input that's stored separately from the main free-form topic text.

%X% *NOTE:* User home topics are located in the %WIKITOOLNAME%.%MAINWEB% web - don't try to move them or create them in other webs. From any other web, user signatures have to point to %WIKITOOLNAME%.%MAINWEB% web, using a =%MAINWEB%.<nop>UserName= or =%<nop>MAINWEB%.<nop>UserName= format. (The =%<nop>MAINWEB%= variable is an advantage if you ever change the %MAINWEB% web name, but the standard =%MAINWEB%.<nop>UserName= is easier for users to enter, which is the bottom line!

#CreateWeb
---+++ Adding a New Web

To create a new web:
	1. *Create* a new web data directory under =twiki/data= and check the file permission of the directory.
		* Use a name consisting of characters =A..Z= , =a..z= but __not__ in WikiNotation.  (The name should start with one (or more) uppercase letters, but have no uppercase letters after the first group -- if it starts with a lowercase letter or is a WikiWord, some features of TWiki will not work as expected.)
	1. *Copy* all files from the =twiki/data/_default= directory to the new data directory, preserving the original files' owner, group and permissions (on Unix, use =cp -p=). The data files must be writable by the owner the CGI scripts are running on (usually, =nobody=). 
		* %T% *HINT:* You can set permissions of =.txt= and =.txt,v= files to =-rw-rw-rw-= (666) and then edit the topic using your browser; RCS will restore the file permissions correctly when saving the topic.
	1. *Add* the new web to the web list (visible in the upper right corner of each topic) by editing the site-level preferences, %TWIKIWEB%.%WIKIPREFSTOPIC%:
		* Add the new web to the =%<nop>WIKIWEBLIST%= variable.
	1. *Update* the web settings by editing the <nop>WebPreferences topic of the new web:
		* Customize the =%<nop>WEBTOPICLIST%= variable to contain the web-specific links you prefer.
		* Set the WEBBGCOLOR variable to a color. The number represents the unique color for the web.
		* Set Plugins, access privileges, custom variables, other web-level options (ex: =%<nop>WEBCOPYRIGHT%= can be set for an individual web).
	1. *Test* the new web: view pages, create a new page.

Request and download the TWiki 01-Sep-2001 distribution in Unix ZIP format from http://TWiki.org/download.html. _(To install TWiki on <nop>SourceForge, for use on a software development project, read TWiki:Codev/SourceForgeHowTo.)_ 
d17 1

__NOTE:__ _If you don't have access to your Web server configuration files - for example, if you're installing on an ISP-hosted account - use the [[#StepOneB][alternative Step 1]] instead._
d23 2
a24 1
	  <br> __NOTE:__ The =ScriptAlias= __must__ come before the =Alias=, otherwise, Apache will fail to correctly set up =/twiki/bin/=, by treating it as just another subdirectory of the =/twiki/= alias.

			* *HINT:* Run the =testenv= script from your browser: =http://yourdomain.com/twiki/bin/testenv=. It will show you the user name of the CGI scripts, a table listing all CGI environment variables, and a test of your =twiki/lib/TWiki.cfg= configuration file (you'll configure that in a minute).
d88 7
a94 1
	* __NOTE:__ The =twiki/data/*/*.txt,v= RCS repository files in the installation package are locked by user =nobody=. If your CGI scripts are __not__ running as user =nobody=, it's not possible to check in files (you'll see that the revision number won't increase after saving a topic). In this case, you need to unlock all repository files (check the RCS man pages) and lock them with a different user, ex =www-data=, or delete them all - new files will be automatically created the first time each topic is edited. A simple way to change ownership is with a search-and-replace in all files; for example, using sed: <br /> =for f in *,v; do sed 's/nobody\:/www-data\:/' $f &gt; x; mv x $f; done=

		* Make sure RCS is installed. Set =$rcsDir= in =twiki/lib/TWiki.cfg= to mach the location of your RCS binaries.

		1. *Rename* file =.htaccess.txt= in the =twiki/bin= directory to =.htaccess= and change it to your needs. For details, consult the HTTP server documentation (for Apache server: <a href="http://www.apache.org/docs/mod/directives.html">[1]</a>, <a href="http://www.mcs.kent.edu/system/web_help/htaccess/introduction.html">[2]</a>). In particular, the following <font color="red">red</font> part needs to be configured correctly: <br>
		  =Redirect <font color="red">/urlpath/to/TWiki/index.html</font> http<nop>://<font color="red">your.domain.com/urlpath/to/TWiki/bin/</font>view= <br>
		  =AuthUserFile <font color="red">/filepath/to/TWiki/data/</font>.htpasswd= <br>
		  =ErrorDocument 401 <font color="red">/urlpath/to/TWiki/bin/</font>oops/TWiki/TWikiRegistration?template=oopsauth=
			* __NOTE:__ In case you renamed the CGI script files to have a file extension you need to reflect that in the =edit=, =view=, =preview=, etc entries in =.htaccess=.
			* __NOTE:__ The browser should ask for login name and password when you click on the <u>Edit</u> link. In case =.htaccess= does not have the desired effect you need to enable it: Add "AllowOverride All" to the Directory section of =access.conf= for your =twiki/bin= directory.
			* __NOTE:__ The distribution package has a =twiki/data/.htpasswd= file which contains some TWiki core team user accounts and a guest user account. You probably want to remove those accounts by deleting the entries in =.htpasswd=. Do not remove the guest user in case you want to allow guest logins.
d133 1
a133 1
			* __HINT:__ You can customize the registration form by deleting or adding input tags. The =name=""= parameter of the input tags must start with: ="Twk0..."= (if this is an optional entry), or ="Twk1..."= (if this is a required entry). This ensures that the fields are processed correctly.
d135 1
a135 1
		* __NOTE:__ When a user registers, a new line with the username and encrypted password is added to the =data/.htpasswd= file. The =.htpasswd= file that comes with the TWiki installation includes user accounts for TWiki core team members that are used for testing on TWiki.org. You can edit the file and delete those lines.
d146 1
a146 1
		* Use a name starting with characters =A..Z=, followed by =a..z= and/or =0..9= characters, but __not__ a WikiWord.
d148 1
a148 1
		* __HINT:__ You can set permissions of =.txt= and =.txt,v= files to =-rw-rw-rw-= (666) and then edit the topic using your browser; RCS will restore the file permissions correctly when saving the topic.
d164 1
a164 1
__NOTE:__ User home topics are located in the %WIKITOOLNAME%.%MAINWEB% web - don't try to move them or create them in other webs. From any other web, user signatures have to point to %WIKITOOLNAME%.%MAINWEB% web, using a =%MAINWEB%.<nop>UserName= or =%<nop>MAINWEB%.<nop>UserName= format. (The =%<nop>MAINWEB%= variable is an advantage if you ever change the %MAINWEB% web name, but the standard =%MAINWEB%.<nop>UserName= is easier for users to enter, which is the bottom line!

---+++ Enabling Basic Authentication (.htaccess)

	* If TWiki is installed on a non-authenticated server - not using SSL - and you'd like to authenticate users:
		1. *Rename* file =.htaccess.txt= in the =twiki/bin= directory to =.htaccess= and change it to your needs. For details, consult the HTTP server documentation (for Apache server: <a href="http://www.apache.org/docs/mod/directives.html">[1]</a>, <a href="http://www.mcs.kent.edu/system/web_help/htaccess/introduction.html">[2]</a>). In particular, the following <font color="red">red</font> part needs to be configured correctly: <br>
		  =Redirect <font color="red">/urlpath/to/TWiki/index.html</font> http<nop>://<font color="red">your.domain.com/urlpath/to/TWiki/bin/</font>view= <br>
		  =AuthUserFile <font color="red">/filepath/to/TWiki/data/</font>.htpasswd= <br>
		  =ErrorDocument 401 <font color="red">/urlpath/to/TWiki/bin/</font>oops/TWiki/TWikiRegistration?template=oopsauth=
			* __NOTE:__ In case you renamed the CGI script files to have a file extension you need to reflect that in the =edit=, =view=, =preview=, etc entries in =.htaccess=.
			* __NOTE:__ The browser should ask for login name and password when you click on the <u>Edit</u> link. In case =.htaccess= does not have the desired effect you need to enable it: Add "AllowOverride All" to the Directory section of =access.conf= for your =twiki/bin= directory.
		1. *Copy* the TWikiRegistrationPub topic to TWikiRegistration. Do that by either editing the topics in the%TWIKIWEB% web, or by renaming the =.txt= and =.txt,v= files in the =twiki/data/%TWIKIWEB%= directory.
			* You can customize the registration form by deleting or adding input tags. The =name=""= parameter of the input tags must start with: ="Twk0..."= (if this is an optional entry), or ="Twk1..."= (if this is a required entry). This ensures that the fields are processed correctly.

		* __NOTE:__ When a user registers, a new line with the username and encrypted password is added to the =data/.htpasswd= file. The =.htpasswd= file that comes with the TWiki installation includes user accounts for TWiki core team members that are used for testing on TWiki.org. You can edit the file and delete those lines.

	* Restart Apache by =/etc/rc.d/rc5.d/S85httpd restart= .
	* Test if the =twiki/bin= directory is CGI-enabled:
		* Enter the URL of that directory into your browser ( =http://your.domain.com/twiki/bin= ). It is not set correctly as cgi-bin in case you get something like ="Index of /twiki/bin"= . It is OK if you get a message like ="Forbidden. You don't have permission to access /twiki/bin/ on this server."=
		* Execute the =testenv= script from your browser ( =http://your.domain.com/twiki/bin/testenv= ). It shows a table with all CGI environment variables. It also tests the settings in your =twiki/lib/TWiki.cfg= configuration file, which you will set later on.

---+++ Step 3: Enable Perl File Permissions

	* Make sure Perl 5 and the Perl CGI library are installed on your system. The default location of Perl is =/usr/bin/perl=. If Perl is installed elsewhere, change the first line of all scripts in the =twiki/bin= directory (or create a symbolic link from =/usr/bin/perl=).
		* *IMPORTANT:* On most ISP virtual domain accounts, Perl CGI scripts require a =.cgi= extension to run. Some systems need =.pl=, the regular Perl extension. Change all =twiki/bin= scripts appropriately if necessary.

Replace user =nobody= with another user if your Web server executes scripts under a different name (default for Debian is =www-data=). Also, you can substitute user =twiki= with your own username.

		* *You have control* over the Web server configuration files. In case you don't - you may be installing on an ISP-hosted server - follow the steps but use these directories instead: 

| *TWiki dir:* | *What it is:* | *Where to copy:* | *Example:* |

		* Execute the =testenv= script from your browser ( =http://your.domain.com/twiki/bin/testenv= ). It shows a table with all CGI environment variables. It also tests the settings in your ==twiki/lib/TWiki.cfg== configuration file, which you will set later on.
d78 7
a84 7
	* Make sure Perl 5 and the Perl CGI library are installed on your system. Default location of Perl executable is =/usr/bin/perl=. In case Perl is installed in a different location, the first line of all Perl scripts in the ==twiki/bin== directory must be changed (alternatively you can create a symbolic link from ==/usr/bin/perl== ).
		* *IMPORTANT:* On most ISP virtual domain accounts, Perl CGI scripts require a ==.cgi== extension to run. Some systems need ==.pl==, the regular Perl extension. Change all ==twiki/bin== scripts appropriately if necessary.
	* To be able to edit the Perl scripts and ==.tmpl== files it is necessary to ==chown== and ==chgrp -R twiki== so all the files have the owner you want.
	* The CGI scripts execute as ==nobody==. Set the file permission of all Perl scripts in the ==twiki/bin== directory as executable to ==-rwxr-xr-x== (755).
	* Set the permission of all files below =twiki/data= so that they are writable by user =nobody=. A simple way is to ==chmod== them to ==-rw-rw-r--== (664) and to ==chown== them to ==nobody==.
	* Set the permission of the ==twiki/data== directory and its subdirectories so that files in there are writable by user ==nobody==. A simple way is to chmod them to ==drwxrwxr-x== (775) and to ==chown== them to ==nobody==.
	* Set the permission of the =twiki/pub= directory and all its subdirectories so that files in there are writable by user =nobody=. A simple way is to ==chmod== them to ==drwxrwxr-x== (775) and to ==chown== them to ==nobody==.

	* Note in case the CGI scripts are __not__ running as user =nobody=: The =*,v= RCS repository files delivered with the installation package are locked by user =nobody= . In case the user is different (e.g. =www-data= ), it is not possible to check in files, this has the effect that the topic version number does not increase when saving a topic. In this case you need to unlock all repository files and lock them as user =www-data= (check the rcs man pages), or simply delete all the repository files. A simple way to switch the locker of the RCS files is to use sed: <br> =for f in *,v; do sed 's/nobody\:/www-data\:/' $f &gt; x; mv x $f; done=
	* *Security issue:* Directories =twiki/data= , =twiki/templates= and all its subdirectories should be set so that they are *not* visible as a URL. (Alternatively, move the directories to a place where they are not visible, and change the variables in =twiki/lib/TWiki.cfg= accordingly)

	* Point your Web browser at ==http://your.domain.com/twiki/bin/view== and start TWiki-ing away!
	* Edit the TWikiPreferences topic in the TWiki:%TWIKIWEB% web to set the WIKIWEBMASTER email address, the WEBCOPYRIGHT message and other preferences.
	* Edit the WebNotify topic in all webs and set the users you want to notify.

Complete a Standard Installation and your new TWiki site should be up and running. You can develop and manage most aspects of your site from the browser interface. Core set-up functions require direct access to the server file system, via Telnet or FTP. You can make server-level site changes during installation, or at any time afterwards.

---+++ Creating a New Web

	* To create a new web:
		1. *Create* a new web data directory under =twiki/data= and check the file permission of the directory.
			* Use a name consisting of characters =A..Z= , =a..z= but __not__ in WikiNotation.
		1. *Copy* all files from the =twiki/data/_default= directory to the new data directory, preserving the original files' owner, group and permissions (on Unix, use =cp -p=). The data files must be writable by the owner the CGI scripts are running on (usually, =nobody=). 
			* __Hint:__ You can set permissions of =.txt= and =.txt,v= files to =-rw-rw-rw-= (666) and then edit the topic using your browser; RCS will restore the file permissions correctly when saving the topic.
		1. *Add* the new web to the web list (visible in the upper right corner of each topic) by editing the site-level preferences, %TWIKIWEB%.%WIKIPREFSTOPIC%:
			* Add the new web to the =%<nop>WIKIWEBLIST%= variable.
		1. *Update* the web settings by editing the <nop>WebPreferences topic of the new web:
			* Customize the =%<nop>WEBTOPICLIST%= variable to contain the web-specific links you prefer.
			* Set the WEBBGCOLOR variable to a color. The number represents the unique color for the web.
			* Set Plugins, access privileges, custom variables, other web-level options (ex: =%<nop>WEBCOPYRIGHT%= can be set for an individual web).
		1. *Add* the new web to the color-coded web directory table by editing the %TWIKIWEB%.TWikiWebsTable topic.
		1. *Test* the new web: view pages, create a new page.

	* That's it for a basic new web set-up. You can also further customize the web:
		* Create customized templates in the new templates directory (otherwise, templates are inherited from =twiki/templates=).
			* __NOTE:__ For web-specific templates in a =templates= subdirectory, ex: =twiki/templates/someweb=.
		* Create TWikiForms to add form-based page input that's stored separately from the main free-form topic text.

	* __NOTE:__ User home topics are located in the %WIKITOOLNAME%.%MAINWEB% web - don't try to move them or create them in other webs. From any web you can refer to users located in the %WIKITOOLNAME%.%MAINWEB% web with =%MAINWEB%.<nop>UserName= or =%<nop>MAINWEB%.<nop>UserName= - using the =%<nop>MAINWEB%= variable is preferable, particularly if you might change the %MAINWEB% web name.

	* You can add new =%<nop>VARIABLES%=. Define site-level variables in the TWikiPreferences topic. See also TWikiVariables.
	* You can add new rendering rules or add new functionality to TWiki. To insure an easy upgrade of TWiki, it is recommended to do this sort of customization with TWikiPlugins and the Plugins API.

			* __NOTE:__ You can customize the registration form if needed, like deleting or adding input tags. The =name=""= parameter of the input tags must start with: ="Twk0..."= (if this is an optional entry), or ="Twk1..."= (if this is a required entry). This will ensure that the fields are processed correctly.

		* A new line containing user name and encrypted password gets added to the =data/.htpasswd= file when a users registers. The file that comes with the TWiki installation contains a few user accounts of TWiki core team members (needed for testing). You can edit the file and delete those lines.

These installation steps use the Apache web server on Linux as an example. TWiki should run on other web servers and Unix systems as well. (TWiki on Windows is possible, but has not been well-documented. More on that at http://TWiki.org/cgi-bin/view/Codev/TWikiOnWindows.)

		* *User =nobody=* is used for all files manipulated by the CGI scripts (executed by the Web server), and user =twiki= for all other files. Replace user =nobody= with another user if your Web server executes scripts under a different name (default for Debian is =www-data=). Also, you can substitute user =twiki= with your own username.

Read http://TWiki.org/cgi-bin/view/Codev/SourceForgeHowTo in case you want to install TWiki on <nop>SourceForge.

		* Execute the =testenv= script from your browser ( =http://your.domain.com/twiki/bin/testenv= ). It shows a table with all CGI environment variables and tests the settings in your ==twiki/bin/wikicfg.pm== configuration file.
d67 4
a70 4
	* The scripts execute as ==nobody==. Set the file permission of all Perl scripts in the ==twiki/bin== directory as executable to ==-rwxr-xr-x== (755).
	* Set the permission of all files below =twiki/data= so that they are writable by user =nobody=. A simple way is to ==chmod== them to ==-rw-rw-rw-== (666).
	* Set the permission of the ==twiki/data== directory and its subdirectories so that files in there are writable by user ==nobody==. A simple way is to chmod them to ==drwxrwxrwx== (777).
	* Set the permission of the =twiki/pub= directory and all its subdirectories so that files in there are writable by user =nobody=. A simple way is to chmod them to ==drwxrwxrwx== (777).
d74 1
a74 1
	* Edit the file ==twiki/bin/wikicfg.pm== and set the variables at the beginning of the file to your needs.
d76 5

		* Make sure RCS is installed. Set =$rcsDir= in =twiki/bin/wikicfg.pm= to mach the location of your RCS binaries.
	* Note in case the cgi scripts are __not__ running as user =nobody=: The =*,v= RCS repository files delivered with the installation package are locked by user =nobody= . In case the user is different (e.g. =www-data= ), it is not possible to check in files, this has the effect that the topic version number does not increase when saving a topic. In this case you need to unlock all repository files and lock them as user =www-data= (check the rcs man pages), or simply delete all the repository files. A simple way to switch the locker of the RCS files is to use sed: <br> =for f in *,v; do sed 's/nobody\:/www-data\:/' $f &gt; x; mv x $f; done=
	* *Security issue:* Directories =twiki/data= , =twiki/templates= and all its subdirectories should be set so that they are *not* visible as a URL. (Alternatively, move the directries to a place where they are not visible, and change the variables in =twiki/bin/wikicfg.pm= accordingly)
	* Enable email notification of topic changes, [[TWikiDocumentation#TWiki_Notification_of_Changes][Notification of Changes]] has more. 
	* Add the [[http://TWiki.org/cgi-bin/view/Main/PoweredByTWikiLogo][TWiki:Main.PoweredByTWikiLogo]] to your %MAINWEB%.WebHome topic.

	* If you use =.htaccess=, edit the file and add the file extension to =edit=, =view=, =preview=, etc.

		* Use a name for the web consisting of characters =A..Z= , =a..z= but *not* in WikiNotation.
		* Create a new template directory under =twiki/templates= .
		* Create a new data directory under =twiki/data= and check the file permission of the directory.
		* Copy the =Web*.txt= files from the =twiki/data/Main= directory to the new data directory, preserving the original files' owner, group and permissions ( on Unix use =cp -p= ). The data files must be writable by the owner the CGI scripts are running on ( usually =nobody= ). Hint: You can set permissions of =.txt= and =.txt,v= files to =-rw-rw-rw-= and then edit the topic using your browser, RCS will restore the file permission correctly when saving the topic.
		* Add the new web to the web list (visible in the upper right corner of each topic) by editing the site-level preferences %TWIKIWEB%.%WIKIPREFSTOPIC%:
d104 13
a116 9
		* Add the new web to the web table (at the bottom of each WebHome topic) by editing the %TWIKIWEB%.TWikiWebsTable topic.
		* Change the web preferences by editing the <nop>WebPreferences topic of the new web:
			* Set the WEBBGCOLOR variable to a color of your taste. The number represents the unique color for the web (consult an HTML book for colors.)
			* Customize the =%<nop>WEBTOPICLIST%= variable to contain the web specific links you prefer.
			* Optional: Set the =%<nop>WEBCOPYRIGHT%= variable to have a web-specific copyright text (at the bottom of each topic).
		* If needed, create customized templates in the new templates directory. (Non existing templates are inherited from =twiki/templates= )
		* If you want to use Form Templates - see [[TWikiDocumentation#TWiki_Form_Templates][TWiki Form Template]]
		* In case you want usage statistics for this web: Copy file =WebStatistics.txt= from the =twiki/data/Main= directory to the new data directory. Edit topic <nop>WebStatistics in the new web and delete old usage entries.
		* Note that user home topics are only located in the %WIKITOOLNAME%.%MAINWEB% web, so don't try to move them or create them in other webs. From any web you can refer to users located in the %WIKITOOLNAME%.%MAINWEB% web like =%MAINWEB%.<nop>UserName= or =%<nop>MAINWEB%.<nop>UserName=.

d124 2
a125 2
	* If you are on a non authenticated server (i.e. not using SSL) and you would like to authenticate users:
		* Rename file =.htaccess.txt= in the =twiki/bin= directory to =.htaccess= and change it to your needs. For details consult the HTTP server documentation (for Apache server: <a href="http://www.apache.org/docs/mod/directives.html">[1]</a>, <a href="http://www.mcs.kent.edu/system/web_help/htaccess/introduction.html">[2]</a>). In particular, the following <font color="red">red</font> part needs to be configured correctly: <br>
d129 4
a132 3
			* __Note:__ The browser should ask for login name and password when you click on the <u>Edit</u> link. In case =.htaccess= does not have the desired effect you need to enable it: Add "AllowOverride All" to the Directory section of =access.conf= for your =twiki/bin= directory.
		* Copy the TWikiRegistrationPub topic to TWikiRegistration. Do that by either editing the topics in the%TWIKIWEB% web, or by renaming the =.txt= and =.txt,v= files in the =twiki/data/%TWIKIWEB%= directory.
			* __Note:__ You can customize the registration form if needed, like deleting or adding input tags. The =name=""= parameter of the input tags must start with: ="Twk0..."= (if this is an optional entry), or ="Twk1..."= (if this is a required entry). This will ensure that the fields are processed correctly.

	* Request the TWiki distribution (in Unix ZIP format) from http://TWiki.org/download.html .
d31 3
a33 1
	* Here are example =httpd.conf= entries:
d46 4
d53 17
a69 15
		* Execute the =testenv= script from your browser ( =http://your.domain.com/twiki/bin/testenv= ). It shows a table with all CGI environment variables and tests the settings in your =twiki/bin/wikicfg.pm= configuration file.
	* Make sure PERL 5 and the PERL CGI library is installed on your system. Default location of PERL executable is =/usr/bin/perl= . In case PERL is installed in a different location, the first line of all perl scripts in the =twiki/bin= directory need to be changed (alternatively you can create a symbolic link from =/usr/bin/perl= ).
	* To be able to edit the perl scripts and .tmpl files it is necessary to =chown= and =chgrp -R twiki= so all the files have the owner you want.
	* The scripts execute as =nobody= . Set the file permission of all Perl scripts in the =twiki/bin= directory as executable to =-rwxr-xr-x= .
	* Set the permission of all files below =twiki/data= so that they are writable by user =nobody=. A simple way is to chmod them to 666 ( =-rw-rw-rw-= ).
	* Set the permission of the =twiki/data= directory and all its subdirectories so that files in there are writable by user =nobody=. A simple way is to chmod them to 777 ( =drwxrwxrwx= ).
	* Set the permission of the =twiki/pub= directory and all its subdirectories so that files in there are writable by user =nobody=. A simple way is to chmod them to 777 ( =drwxrwxrwx= ).
	* Edit the file =twiki/bin/wikicfg.pm= and set the variables at the beginning of the file to your needs.
	* Make sure RCS is installed. Set =$rcsDir= in =twiki/bin/wikicfg.pm= to mach the location of your RCS binaries.
	* Point your browser at http://your.domain.com/twiki/bin/view and start TWiki-ing away!
	* Using your browser, edit the TWikiPreferences topic in the TWiki.%TWIKIWEB% web to set the WIKIWEBMASTER email address, the WEBCOPYRIGHT message and other preferences.
	* Note in case the cgi scripts must have a file extension like =.pl= or =.cgi=:
		* Add the extension to all the scripts (except for the =.pm= ones) in =twiki/bin=
		* Edit =wikicfg.pm= and set the file extension in the =$scriptSuffix= variable.
		* If you use =.htaccess=, edit the file and add the file extension to =edit=, =view=, =preview=, etc.
d71 2
a72 2
	* Security issue: Directories =twiki/data= , =twiki/templates= and all its subdirectories should be set so that they are *not* visible as a URL. (Alternatively, move the directries to a place where they are not visible, and change the variables in =twiki/bin/wikicfg.pm= accordingly)
	* Enable email notification of topic changes, [[TWikiDocumentation#TWiki_Notification_of_Changes][Notification of Changes]] has more. Using your browser, edit also the WebNotify topic in all webs and set the users you want to notify.
d75 1
a75 15
---+++ Adding Variables &amp; Rendering Rules 

	* Optional: You can add new rendering rules or new %<nop>VARIABLES%. To insure an easy upgrade of TWiki it is recommended to do this customization in =twiki/bin/wikicfg.pm= , not =twiki/bin/wiki.pm= .

---+++ Enabling Basic Authentication (.htaccess)

	* Optional: If you are on a non authenticated server (i.e. not using SSL) and you would like to authenticate users:
		* Rename file =.htaccess.txt= in the =twiki/bin= directory to =.htaccess= and change it to your needs. For details consult the HTTP server documentation (for Apache server: <a href="http://www.apache.org/docs/mod/directives.html">[1]</a>, <a href="http://www.mcs.kent.edu/system/web_help/htaccess/introduction.html">[2]</a>). In particular, the following <font color="red">red</font> part needs to be configured correctly: <br>
		  =Redirect <font color="red">/urlpath/to/TWiki/index.html</font> http<nop>://<font color="red">your.domain.com/urlpath/to/TWiki/bin/</font>view= <br>
		  =AuthUserFile <font color="red">/filepath/to/TWiki/data/</font>.htpasswd= <br>
		  =ErrorDocument 401 <font color="red">/urlpath/to/TWiki/bin/</font>oops/TWiki/TWikiRegistration?template=oopsauth=
			* __Note:__ The browser should ask for login name and password when you click on the <u>Edit</u> link. In case =.htaccess= does not have the desired effect you need to enable it: Add "AllowOverride All" to the Directory section of =access.conf= for your =twiki/bin= directory.
		* Copy the TWikiRegistrationPub topic to TWikiRegistration. Do that by either editing the topics in the%TWIKIWEB% web, or by renaming the =.txt= and =.txt,v= files in the =twiki/data/%TWIKIWEB%= directory.
			* __Note:__ You can customize the registration form if needed, like deleting or adding input tags. The =name=""= parameter of the input tags must start with: ="Twk0..."= (if this is an optional entry), or ="Twk1..."= (if this is a required entry). This will ensure that the fields are processed correctly.
		* A new line containing user name and encrypted password gets added to the =data/.htpasswd= file when a users registers. The file that comes with the TWiki installation contains a few user accounts of TWiki core team members (needed for testing). You can edit the file and delete those lines.
d77 8
a84 1
---+++ Generating Site Usage Statistics
d86 1
a86 10
	* Optional: You can automatically generate usage statistics for all webs. To enable this:
		* Make sure variable =$doLogTopicView, $doLogTopicSave and $doLogTopicUpload= in =wikicfg.pm= are set. This will generate log entries in file =twiki/data/log&lt;date&gt;.txt= .
		* Topic WebStatistics must be present in all webs where you want to have statistics. You can use the topic in the Main web as a template.
		* Call the =twiki/bin/statistics= script from a cron job, once a day is recommended. This will update the WebStatistics topics in all webs.
		* __Attention:__ The script must run as the same user as the CGI scripts are running, which is user =nobody= on most systems. Example crontab entry: <br> =0 0 * * * (cd /path/to/TWiki/bin; ./statistics &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1)=
		* There is a workaround in case you can't run the script as user =nobody= : Run the utility =twiki/bin/geturl= in your cron job and specify the URL of the =twiki/bin/statistics= script as a parameter. Example: <br> =0 0 * * * (cd /path/to/TWiki/bin; ./geturl mydomain.com /urlpath/to/TWiki/bin/statistics &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1)=
		* The =twiki/bin/statistics= script can also be executed as a CGI script, just enter the URL in your browser. Examples:
			* Update current month for all webs: <br> =http://mydomain.com/twiki/bin/statistics=
			* Update current month for Main web only: <br> =http://mydomain.com/twiki/bin/statistics/Main=
			* Update January 2000 for Main web: <br> =http://mydomain.com/twiki/bin/statistics/Main?logdate=200001=

In case the user is different (e.g. =www-data= ), it is not possible to check in files, this has the effect that the topic version number does not increase when saving a topic. In this case you need to unlock all repository files and lock them as user =www-data= (check the rcs man pages), or simply delete all the repository files. A simple way to switch the locker of the RCS files is to use sed: <br> =for f in *,v; do sed 's/nobody/www-data/' $f &gt; x; mv x $f; done=

	* Point your browser at http://your.domain.com/twiki/bin/view and start wiki-ing away!

	* Enable email notification of topic changes, <A href="TWikiDocumentation#notification">(3)</A> has more.

	* Optional: You can add new rendering rules or new %<nop>variables%. To insure an easy upgrade of TWiki it is recommended to do this customization in =twiki/bin/wikicfg.pm= , not =twiki/bin/wiki.pm= .

		* Copy the TWikiRegistrationPub topic to TWikiRegistration. You can customize the topic if needed. __Note:__ You can delete or add new input variables to the registration form. The =name=""= parameter of the input tags must start with: ="Twk0..."= (if this is an optional entry), or ="Twk1..."= (if this is a required entry). This will ensure that the fields are processed correctly.

		* Copy the files =WebHome.txt= , =WebPreferences.txt= , =WebNotify.txt= , =WebSearch.txt= and =WebStatistics.txt= from the =twiki/data/Main= directory to the new data directory, preserving the original files' owner, group and permissions ( on Unix use =cp -p= ). The data files must be writable by the owner the CGI scripts are running on ( usually =nobody= ). Hint: You can set permissions of =.txt= and =.txt,v= files to =-rw-rw-rw-= and then edit the topic using your browser, RCS will restore the file permission correctly when saving the topic.
		* Add the new web to the web list (on top of each topic) by editing the site-level preferences %MAINWEB%.%WIKIPREFSTOPIC%:

		* Add the new web to the web table (at the bottom of each WebHome topic) by editing the %MAINWEB%.TWikiWebsTable topic.

		* If you want to use a category table, copy the three files =twikicatitems.tmpl= , =twikicatedit.tmpl= and =twikicatview.tmpl= from the =twiki/templates/Know= directory to the new templates directory, and customize it. The TWiki Category Table section has more.
