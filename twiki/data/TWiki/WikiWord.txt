---+!! What is a !WikiWord?
A !WikiWord consists of two or more words with initial capitals, run together. *WikiWords are topic names.* A TWiki topic name always has a fixed format: two or more words with initial capitals, run together. Like the name of the current topic: *WikiWord*. When you type the name of a topic, you create a link to that topic. You type =%HOMETOPIC%= and on saving the page this becomes %HOMETOPIC%. It's as easy as that.

When you type a !WikiWord, you establish a hyperlink. It's as easy as that.

!WikiWord linking is easy to use:
   * You don't have to know the full path to where the topic is stored - you just type the name
   * You don't need to write HTML
   * Without HTML, the topic text is easier to read when editing
   * Easy linking leads to interesting texts with links placed in context

!WikiWords are styled like this because:
   * It makes Wiki hyperlinks instantly recognizable
   * It leads to interesting Wiki topics
   * It avoids the need to fiddle with HTML tags
   * It avoids over-general topics because at least two words are required

---++ Syntax of a !WikiWord

   * Uppercase letter(s)
   * Lowercase letter(s) or numbers(s)
   * Uppercase letter(s)
   * Optional lowercase or uppercase letter(s) or number(s)

---++ Good examples of !WikiWords

   * WikiWord
   * GoodStyle
   * VersionFiveDotThree
   * ReleaseVersion5dot3
   * AVeryLongWikiTopicNameIsAlsoPossible: wherever an uppercase or lowercase letter is allowed, a group of letters of the same case is allowed
   * YearTwoThousand
   * Nine2Five: Note that numbers are considered to be lowercase letters in !WikiWords

---++ Bad examples of !WikiWords:

   * Web: Name without the uppercase letter(s), lowercase letter(s), uppercase letter(s) sequence
   * 5TWiki: Name beginning with a number
   * Know-How: Name with dashes in between

---++ Variations in linking

When you write the name of a topic, it becomes a link. There are more ways

   * To write a custom *link label*, use bracket notation: =[<nop>[TWikiAccessControl][access control]]= - this becomes: [[TWikiAccessControl][access control]]
   * To link to a topic in *another web*, write: =Sandbox.WebSearch= - this becomes: Sandbox.WebSearch
   * To show the web name in the link use bracket notation: =[<nop>[Sandbox.%HOMETOPIC%]]= - this becomes: [[Sandbox.%HOMETOPIC%]]
   * To link to a topic on *another Wiki site*, use: =TWiki:Main/WebHome= - this becomes: TWiki:Main/WebHome (sites are defined in the InterwikiPlugin)
   * To link to a part on the *same page*, write a "#" followed by the name of an anchor. The anchor is a "#" followed by a name which must be a !WikiName. Example =#MyAnchor=. You can also link to an anchor on another page: =%TWIKIWEB%.%HOMETOPIC%#MyAnchor=.
   * To link to a header on the *same page*, write a "#" followed by the header text, with spaces replaced by underscores (and =!= removed): =[<nop>[#Good_examples_of_WikiWords]]= becomes: [[#Good_examples_of_WikiWords]]. You can also link to a header on another page: =%TWIKIWEB%.%HOMETOPIC%#Disclaimer= becomes: %TWIKIWEB%.%HOMETOPIC%#Disclaimer.

---++ Hints
   * Insert !WikiWords wherever you can. Rich linking helps to make a Wiki successful.
   * Be specific. All topics in a web share one name space. For example, instead of =FunctionalSpec= write =BreadSlicerFunctionalSpec= because other projects might also have a functional spec topic.
   * To stop a !WikiWord from being turned into a hyperlink, insert an exclamation point immediately before the !WikiWord. For example, write =!<nop>SunOS= to get !SunOS.
   * Create topics with singular names. Plural <nop>WikiWords are automatically linked to the singular topic, i.e. the link WikiWords links to the topic WikiWord (works only in English).
   * Sometimes you have to be creative to find a good <nop>WikiName. Examples:
      * To create a topic about the the *Bread Slicer 1.2* product, use =BreadSlicer1dot2= or =BreadSlicer1pt2=, but not =BreadSlicer1.2=.
      * Numbers are considered lowercase which makes =Year2K= and =Y2K= !WikiWords but not =Y2000= and =Y2k=.
   * Turn acronyms into !WikiWords, i.e. take =FaqIndex= for a "FAQ index" topic.
   * It is possible to turn off the auto-linking of !WikiWords and to rely only on the bracket notation. See NOAUTOLINK setting in TWikiPreferences#Default_Web_Preferences.
   * %X% When linking to a <nop>%HOMETOPIC% topic _in another web_, the link will be rendered as the name of the web, e.g. =Sandbox.%HOMETOPIC%= becomes Sandbox.%HOMETOPIC%.
