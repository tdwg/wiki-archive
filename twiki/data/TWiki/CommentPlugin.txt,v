*Comment Plugin lets users quickly post comments to a page without an edit/preview/save cycle.*

<div class="twikiBroadcastMessage" style="background-color:#ffc;">WARNING: TWiki-4 only. If you want to use this plugin with an earlier version of TWiki, please use [[http://twiki.org/cgi-bin/attach/Plugins/CommentPlugin?filename=CommentPlugin.zip&revInfo=1][revision 31 of the zip]].</div>

%TOC%

---++ Features

Inserts an edit box into the page that allows users to type in and save comments. Comments can be made
	* in different formats (as defined by a template),
	* in both forward and reverse chronological order,  
	* signed or unsigned, dated or undated (as defined by a template),
	* in other topics, or other positions within the current topic.

---++ Syntax Rules

Write the command =%<nop>COMMENT{= _attributes_ =}%= anywhere in a TWiki topic. =%<nop>COMMENT%= is also legal.

#StandardAttrs
The following attributes are recognized (see also [[#MoreAttrs][additional attributes]]):
	| *Name* | *Description* |
	| =type= | This is the name of the template to use for this comment. Comment templates are defined in a TWiki template - see [[#TemPlates][Customisation]], below. If this attribute is not defined, the type is whatever is defined by COMMENTPLUGIN_DEFAULT_TYPE, either in this topic or in your WebPreferences. By default this is 'below'. |
	| =default= | Default text to put into the textarea of the prompt. |
	| =target= | Name of the topic to add the comment to. Defaults to the current topic. |
	| =location= | Regular expression specifying the comment location in the target topic. Read _carefully_ below! |
	| =mode= | For compatability with older versions only, synonymous with =type= |
	| =nonotify= | Set to "on" to disable change notification for target topics |
	| =noform= | Set to "on" to disable the automatic form that encloses your comment block - _remember_ to insert =&lt;form&gt;= tags yourself! See CommentPluginExamples#noform for an example. |
	| =nopost= | Set to "on" to disable insertion of the posted text into the topic. |
	| =remove= | Set to "on" to remove the comment prompt after the first time it is clicked. |
	| =button= | Button label text; by default =Add comment=.  |

---+++ Positioning the comment
=%COMMENT= supports several ways to specify _where_ a comment should be inserted in the target topic. This is referred to as the _location_ of the comment.

---++++ Location relative to <code>%COMMENT</code> tag
The default _location_ is the =%COMMENT= tag itself. For example:
<verbatim>
%COMMENT{type="below"}%
</verbatim>
will add comments in the current topic, directly below the =%COMMENT= tag.

---++++ Location relative to a TWiki anchor
The =target= attribute may specify a web, and may also specify an anchor within the target topic; for example, 
<verbatim>
%COMMENT{type="above" target="%MAINWEB%.PersonalRemarks#InsertHere"}%
</verbatim>
This uses a standard TWiki in-topic anchor as the insertion location. See %TWIKIWEB%.TextFormattingRules for more about TWiki anchors.

---++++ Location relative to an arbitrary text string
Getting more sophisticated, you can also specify a regular expression for the target location using the =location= parameter. The target topic is searched for the regular expression, and the comment inserted relative to the string that the search matched. For example,
<verbatim>
%COMMENT{type="above" location="Flights of Fancy"}%
</verbatim>
will place comments above the first occurence of the string =Flights of Fancy= in the current topic.

*Warning* of course, if a user's comment contains the string "Flights of Fancy" they may and up _changing the location_ for the next comment! Also, if you use a tag in the location, then you've just inserted another tag in the page that contains the =%COMMENT=! So be very careful how you specify the RE for =location=. Note that the RE is matched using perl "multiple line" mode, so ^ and $ match the start of a line and the end of a line respectively.

I look forward to someone leveraging this feature to create - for example - threaded conversations using =%COMMENT=.

If you specify an anchor _and_ a =location=, the anchor will be ignored.

---+++ Default templates
Templates are used to define the "comment style" i.e. how comments appear in the page. The default is to add comments in "Blog like" style using bulleted lists, with the most recent comment at the top, but many other styles are available such as tables or Wiki thread mode comments. It is easy to define your own customer styles as well.

A set of default comment templates are shipped with the plugin. These are:
| *Template type* | *Description* |
| =top= | Comments, signed and dated (server time), added at top of the topic (the anchor is ignored) |
| =bottom= | Comments, signed and dated (server time), added at end of the target topic (the anchor is ignored) |
| =above= | Comments, signed and dated (server time), added immediately before the target anchor, or the =%COMMENT= if no anchor is specified |
| =below= | Comments, signed and dated (server time), added immediately below the target anchor, or the =%COMMENT= if no anchor is specified |
| =threadmode= | Wiki thread mode comment, signed and dated (server time) |
| =tableprepend= | Comments, signed and dated (server time), formatted as an HTML table row, added below the anchor (which must be in an HTML &lt;table>) |
| =tableappend= | Comments, signed and dated (server time), formatted as an HTML table row, added above the anchor (which must be in an HTML &lt;table>) |

Your local installation may add more template types as well - see [[#TemPlates][Customisation]], below.

#TemPlates
---++ Customisation
Customisation of the comment plugin requires
	* familiarity with HTML forms
	* some familiarity with the [[%TWIKIWEB%.TWikiTemplates][TWiki templating language]].

To define a comment type, you have to provide two simple template definitions in the template file; one for the prompt box, and one for the generated output. If we have a template type "mytype", these are named =PROMPT:mytype= and =OUTPUT:mytype= respectively. See =comments.tmpl= in the templates directory for examples.

The plugin picks up these template definitions from a standard TWiki template file, =templates/comments.tmpl=. This allows different templates to be defined for different TWiki skins.

---+++ Defining custom templates
By default, =templates/comments.tmpl= includes the topic %TWIKIWEB%.CommentPluginTemplate, which contains all the shipped standard templates and in turn includes %TWIKIWEB%.<nop>UserCommentsTemplate that can include non-standard customisations.

This allows for several levels of customisation:
   1 To *override all default templates, everywhere*, change =comments.tmpl= to include a different topic (this customisation will be lost next time you upgrade, though).
   1 To add *site-wide local template customisations*, add them to %TWIKIWEB%.UserCommentsTemplate (create if it does not exist yet). You can redefine the standard templates here if you want, and your definitions will override the standard definitions.
   1 To override templates on a *web-by-web basis*, add a topic =UserCommentsTemplate= to the web (this will replace %TWIKIWEB%.<nop>UserCommentsTemplate)
   1 To override templates *for a specific skin*, add them to %TWIKIWEB%.<nop>UserComments&lt;Skin&gt;Template (where &lt;Skin&gt; is the name of the skin with the first letter capitalised, e.g. Pattern)

%X% Templates are picked up by following the [[TWikiTemplates#Finding_Templates][standard TWiki rules]] for locating template files. Note that you can use =%TMPL:INCLUDE= to include other files of templates.

---+++ Customisation example
Provide both a =PROMPT= and an =OUTPUT= definition:

<verbatim>
%TMPL:DEF{PROMPT:myComment}%%TMPL:P{promptbox}%%TMPL:END%
%TMPL:DEF{OUTPUT:myComment}%%TMPL:P{outputoneliner}%%POS:TOP%
%TMPL:END%
</verbatim>

Call your custom comment with:

<verbatim>
%COMMENT{type="myComment"}%
</verbatim>

---+++ The =PROMPT= template
The =PROMPT= template defines the contents of an HTML form that is used to capture the comment. This form invokes the comment generator when submitted. Parameters to the comment generator are defined using standard HTML input fields, such as =input=, =textarea= and =select=. The user enters values for these parameters, and these are then available when the =OUTPUT= template is expanded, in the form of <code>%<nop>URLPARAM%</code>s.

Only the input fields of the form need be defined. The plugin automatically generates the <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/form&gt;</code> tags, unless you specify =noform="on"=, in which case you have to provide them yourself. *Note* that you must define a "submit" button if you want the form to work!

#MoreAttrs
---++++ Providing attribute values
If an attribute is given to the =%COMMENT= tag that is not one of the [[#StandardAttrs][standard attributes]], then that attribute is taken as the name of a parameter to be expanded in the =PROMPT= template. Expressions in the template of the form <code>%</code><i>param</i><code>|</code><i>default</i><code>%</code> (e.g. <code>%rows|3%</code>, <code>%button|Push me%</code>) are expanded to the values given in the <code>%COMMENT</code>. For example, if the =PROMPT= template 'example' contains:
<pre>
&lt;textarea rows=%rows|3% cols="%cols|50%" value="%tval|Rubbish%">
</pre>
and the %COMMENT tag is:
<pre>
%<nop>COMMENT{type="example" cols="75"}%
</pre>
then the template will be expanded as
<pre>
&lt;textarea rows="3" cols="75" value="Rubbish">
</pre>

---++++ Special variables
As well as support for all the usual TWiki variables in templates, the following special variables are supported in the =PROMPT= definition:
	 | *Variable* | *Description* |
	 | =%<nop>DISABLED%= | Set to 'disabled' when you cannot comment (e.g. in preview mode). |
	 | =%<nop>MESSAGE%= | The text specified by =default=. This may be overridden by a helpful message when the prompt is DISABLED. |

*EXPERT* Note that when a comment is saved, the TWiki =save= script is invoked on the target topic, with a number of parameters provided by the comment form. Normally the CommentPlugin will provide these fields in the form, but experts can also provide the fields themselves in order to get finer control over what is submitted, or you might want to define your own HTML forms that do comment submission. The parameters that the CommentPlugin recognises are as follows:
| *CGI parameter* | *Description* |
| =comment_action= | Must be =save= to get the CommentPlugin to perform |
| =comment_type= | Type of the OUTPUT template |
| =comment_index= | Zero-based index of the %COMMENT in the source topic. Used to place a post relative to an existing %COMMENT. |
| =comment_anchor= | Anchor taken from the =target= spec |
| =comment_location= | As passed to %COMMENT |
| =comment_nonotify= | As passed to %COMMENT |
| =comment_remove= | Zero-based index of a %COMMENT to remove from the target topic |
| =comment_nopost= | As passed to %COMMENT |
Note that =comment_location= overrides =comment_anchor=, and both override =comment_index=. Example, shows an "I Approve" button that adds your approval signature to the end of the topic:
<verbatim>
<form method="post" action="%SCRIPTURL{save}%/%WEB%/%TOPIC%">
<input type="submit" value="I Approve" />
<input type="hidden" name="comment_action" value="save" />
<input type="hidden" name="comment_type" value="bottom" />
<input type="hidden" name="comment" value="I Approve" />
</form>
</verbatim>

---+++ The =OUTPUT= template
The =OUTPUT= template defines the format for the text that actually gets embedded into the topic. All the usual TWiki variables are available in the =PROMPT= definition, but note that they get expanded _when the comment is inserted in the text_, so time, date and username will refer to the time and date when the comment was made, and the user who made it.

There are also four position tags that are used to indicate where the comment should be placed, relative to the =location= defined in the =%COMMENT= tag:

	 | =%<nop>POS:TOP%= | If present, comments will be inserted *at the top of the topic* i.e. before any other text |
	 | =%<nop>POS:BOTTOM%= | If present, comments will be inserted *at the end of the topic* i.e. after all existing text |
	 | =%<nop>POS:BEFORE%= | If present, comments will be inserted <b>immediately before the =%<nop>COMMENT%= tag</b> |
	 | =%<nop>POS:AFTER%= | If present, comments will be inserted <b>immediately after the =%<nop>COMMENT%= tag</b> |
Note that these position tags are obviously mutually exclusive. If you define more than one, the result is undefined. If none is present, the default is taken from the plugin setting =DEFAULT_TYPE=

All the usual TWikiVariables that can be used in a topic template can also be used in an =OUTPUT= template. See %TWIKIWEB%.TWikiVariables for details.

---++ Settings
<!-- required for compatibility
		* Set SHORTDESCRIPTION = Allows users to quickly post comments to a page without an edit/preview/save cycle.
	* Name of file in the 'templates' directory that contains the comment templates. The default 'comments.tmpl' automatically includes user templates from %TWIKIWEB%.CommentPluginTemplate
		* Set TEMPLATES = comments
	* Default template type (if not present, defaults to "below")
		* Set DEFAULT_TYPE = above
-->
Two TWiki Preference variables are recognised by the CommentPlugin:
| *Preference* | *Default* | *Description* |
| =%<nop>COMMENTPLUGIN_TEMPLATES%= | =comments= | Name of template file in the 'templates' directory that contains the comment templates. The default 'comments.tmpl' automatically includes user templates from %TWIKIWEB%.CommentPluginTemplate, which in turn includes %TWIKIWEB%.UserCommentsTemplate. |
| =%<nop>COMMENTPLUGIN_DEFAULT_TYPE%= | =above= | Default template type |
These can be set in !TWikiPreferences, in !WebPreferences or in individual topics.

---++ Plugin Installation Instructions
	* This plugin is pre-installed in most TWiki releases. However if you need to upgrade the plugin for any reason:
	* Download the archive file from the Plugin web (see below)
	* Unpack the archive in your twiki installation directory.
		* You may need to correct file permissions

The plugin picks up these template definitions from a standard TWiki template file, =templates/comments.tmpl=. This allows different templates to be defined for different TWiki skins. By default, this template includes the topic %TWIKIWEB%.CommentsTemplate, which contains all the shipped standard templates and in turn includes %TWIKIWEB%.<nop>UserCommentsTemplate. This allows for several levels of customisation:
	1 To override all default templates, everywhere, change =comments.tmpl= to include a different topic (this customisation will be lost next time you upgrade, though).
	1 To add site-wide local template customisations, add them to %TWIKIWEB%.<nop>UserCommentsTemplate. You can redefine the standard templates here if you want, and your definitions will override the standard definitions.
	1 To override templates on a web-by-web basis, add a topic !UserCommentsTemplate to the web (this will replace %TWIKIWEB%.<nop>UserCommentsTemplate)
	1 To override templates for a specific skin, add them to %TWIKIWEB%.<nop>UserComments&lt;Skin&gt;Template (where &lt;Skin&gt; is the name of the skin with the first letter capitalised, e.g. Pattern)

The plugin picks up its templates from a standard TWiki template file, named "comments". This allows different templates to be defined for different TWiki skins. This template file may include other template files, or may include a topic from a user web (this is an extension to the normal handling of =%TMPL:INCLUDE= described in the documentation). The shipped plugin defines default templates in =comments.tmpl= and then includes the topic TWiki.CommentsTmpl. If you want to define your own templates, add them to TWiki.UserTemplates. Note that you can use =%TMPL:INCLUDE= in this file to include other files of templates. Note also that if you want to override any of the default templates shipped with the plugin, you can simply do so by defining them in TWiki.UserTemplates, and they will replace the installed versions.

To define a comment type, you have to provide two simple template definitions in the template file; one for the prompt box, and one for the generated output. If we have a template type "mytype", these are named =PROMPT:mytype= and =OUTPUT:mytype= respectively. See =comments.tmpl= in the templates directory for examples.

Only the input fields of the form need be defined. The plugin automatically generates the <code>&gt;form&lt;</code> and <code>&gt:/form&lt;</code> tags. *Note* that you must define a "submit" button if you want the form to work!

#HandlingPageLock
---+ Important Note regarding Locks

The plugin checks if the page is locked for edit. When a locked page is displayed in 'view' mode, comment input is automatically disabled.

Note that if the page was read long time ago, it's possible that page was locked by another user *after* it was read, and the lock is still outstanding. In this case, comments cannot be saved, and you will be redirected to a "topic is locked" page. You then have two options:
	* *Cancel* - throw away your comment and return to viewing the page.
	* *Back* - *WARNING* some browsers might requery the page and *lose* your comments - so test how your browser behaves before using the Back button.

To help avoid edit conflict, a reminder to refresh the page before entering comments is the default text for a =%COMMENT=. When the target page is known to be locked, the =PROMPT= form is automatically disabled.

	 * Make sure you have the TWiki:Plugins/SharedCode module installed. Among other things, TWiki:Plugins/SharedCode includes a compatibility module that enables plugins to use new TWiki features with earlier TWiki releases. If you don't already have it, install it now.
	* Download the ZIP file from the Plugin web (see below)
	* Unzip ==%TOPIC%.zip== in your twiki installation directory. Content:
	| *File:* | *Description:* |
	| ==data/TWiki/CommentPlugin.txt== | Plugin doc page (this page)  |

	| ==lib/TWiki/Plugins/CommentPlugin/build.pl== | Build file |

	* The Plugin depends on the =viewauth= script to authenticate the user. As described in %TWIKIWEB%.TWikiAccessControl, copy the =view= script to =viewauth= (or better, create a symbolic link) and add =viewauth= to the list of authenticated scripts in the =.htaccess= file.

If installed correctly, you should see a =%COMMENT= edit box below here.
