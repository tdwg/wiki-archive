---# TWiki System Requirements

_Server and client requirements_

Low client and server base requirements are core features that keep TWiki widely deployable, particularly across a range of browser platforms and versions.  Many [[TWiki:Plugins.PluginPackage][Plugins]] and [[TWiki:Plugins.ContribPackage][contrib modules]] exist which enhance and expand TWiki's capabilities; they may have additional requirements.

---++ Server Requirements

TWiki is written in Perl 5, uses a number of shell commands, and requires [[http://www.gnu.org/software/rcs/rcs.html][RCS (Revision Control System)]], a GNU Free Software package. TWiki is developed in a basic Linux/Apache environment. It also works with Microsoft Windows, and should have no problem on any other platform that meets the requirements.

| *Resource* | *Required Server Environment *<nop>* |
| Perl | 5.005_03 or higher (5.8.4 or higher is recommended) |
| RCS | 5.7 or higher (including GNU =diff=) %BR% Optional, TWiki includes a pure perl implementation of RCS that can be used instead (although it's slower) |
| GNU =diff= | GNU =diff= 2.7 or higher is required when not using the all-Perl <nop>RcsLite.  %BR% Install on PATH if not included with RCS (check version with =diff -v=)  %BR% Must be the version used by RCS, to avoid problems with binary attachments - RCS may have hard-coded path to =diff= |
| GNU =patch= | For upgrades only: GNU =patch= is required when using the TWiki:Codev.UpgradeTWiki script |
| GNU =fgrep=, =egrep= | Modify command line parameters in configure if you use non-GNU grep programs |
| Cron/scheduler | %BULLET% Unix: =cron= %BB% Windows: =cron= equivalents <!-- SMELL: Macintosh version? --> |
| Web server | Apache is well supported; see TWiki:TWiki.InstallingTWiki#OtherWebServers for other servers |

---+++ Required CPAN Modules
The following Perl modules are used by TWiki:
| *Module* | *Preferred version* |
| Algorithm::Diff (included) | |
| CGI::Carp | >=1.26 |
| Config | >=0 |
| Cwd | >=3.05 | 
| Data::Dumper | >=2.121 |
| Error (included) | |
| File::Copy | >=2.06 |
| File::Find | >=1.05 |
| File::Spec | >=3.05 |
| File::Temp | (included with perl 5.6 and later) |
| !FileHandle | >=2.01 |
| IO::File | >=1.10 |
| Text::Diff (included) | |
| Time::Local | >=1.11 |

---+++ Optional CPAN Modules
The following Perl modules may be used by TWiki:
| *Module* | *Preferred version* | *Description* |
| CGI::Cookie | >=1.24 | Used for session support |
| CGI::Session | >=3.95 | Used for session support |
| Digest::base | | |
| Digest::SHA1 | | |
| Jcode | | Used for I18N support with perl 5.6 |
| Locale::Maketext::Lexicon | >=0 | Used for I18N support |
| Net::SMTP | >=2.29 | Used for sending mail |
| Unicode::Map | | Used for I18N support with perl 5.6 |
| Unicode::Map8 | | Used for I18N support with perl 5.6 |
| Unicode::MapUTF8 | | Used for I18N support with perl 5.6 |
| Unicode::String | | Used for I18N support with perl 5.6 |
| URI | | Used for configure |

Most of them will probably already be available in your installation. You can check version numbers with the =configure= script, or if you're still trying to get to that point, check from the command line like this:
<verbatim>
perl -e 'use FileHandle; print $FileHandle::VERSION."\n"'
</verbatim>
<!--
SMELL: perhaps put download link to TWiki:Plugins.CpanContrib? (which 
also includes prebuilt versions of all of the CPAN modules used by 
all of the plugins checked into SVN)
-->

#ClientRequirements
---++ Client Requirements

The TWiki [[TWikiInstallationGuide][standard installation]] has relatively low browser requirements:

   * HTML 3.2 compliant
   * Cookies, if persistent sessions are required

CSS and Javascript are used in most skins, although there is a low-fat skin (Classic skin) available that minimises these requirements. Some skins will require more recent releases of browsers. The default skin (Pattern) is tested on IE 6, Safari, and Mozilla 5.0 based browsers (such as Firefox).
<!--
SMELL: what are some actual known good version number requirements for these browsers (eg, FireFox 1.0, or 1.0.3, or 1.0.7, or ???), etc.
-->

You can easily select a balance of browser capability versus look and feel. Try the installed skins at %TWIKIWEB%.TWikiSkinBrowser and more at TWiki:Plugins.SkinPackage.

---++ Important note about TWiki Plugins

   * Plugins can require just about anything -  browser-specific functions, stylesheets (CSS), Java applets, cookies, specific Perl modules,... - check the individual Plugin specs.
      * __%T% Note:__ Plugins included in the TWiki distribution do not add requirements, except for the CommentPlugin which requires Perl 5.6.1.

TWiki generates XHTML 1.0 code as long as it is compatible with HTML 3.2.

	* The new TWikiPlugins feature currently does not have any compatibility guidelines for developers. Plugins can require just about anything: browser-specific functions, stylesheets (CSS), Java, cookies, etc.

---++ TWiki File System

You can rename the root TWiki directory - =twiki= - to whatever you like by changing it in the =twiki.cfg= configuration file. However, to keep the current installation and future upgrades simple, you should leave the subdirectory structure intact:

| *Directory:*		  | *Files:*		 | *Used for:* |
| =twiki=			  |  [[#TWikiFiles][list]]  | Start-up info |
| =twiki/bin=		 |  [[#BinFiles][list]]  | Perl scripts  |

| =twiki/pub=		 |  [[#PubFiles][list]]  | Public support files (ex: FileAttachments, images) and RCS histories) |

Server and client system requirements, file system structure
d10 1
a10 1
Low requirements on client-side and server-side environment, to keep TWiki deployment as broad as possible is a key element of the __TWikiMission__. Strict W3C and ECMA standards compliance is also a mandate. These requirements are amended from time to time as technology progresses.
d14 1
a14 1
TWiki is written in *Perl 5* and uses a number of *shell commands*. It requires that *GNU RCS* (Revision Control System) be installed on the same system. Current development is on Linux. the recommended platform, but it can also work with Microsoft Windows and other OS.

d26 1

---++ Client-Side Requirements
d28 1

The basic TWiki engine and templates have a low requirement on the browser:

__WHAT ABOUT WEB STANDARDS BROWSER COMPATIBILITY MOVEMENT & CSS CONTROL__

---+++ Known Issues

	* Some <nop>TWikiSkins may require more, like cookies and <nop>JavaScript

You can rename the root TWiki directory - ==twiki== - to whatever you like by changing it in the ==twiki.cfg== configuration file. However, to keep the current installation and future upgrades simple, you should leave the subdirectory structure intact:

| ==twiki==			  |  [[#TWikiFiles][list]]  | Start-up info |
| ==twiki/bin==		 |  [[#BinFiles][list]]  | Perl scripts  |

| ==twiki/pub==		 |  [[#PubFiles][list]]  | Public support files (ex: FileAttachments, images) and RCS histories) |
| ==twiki/data==		|  [[#DataFiles][list]]  | Topic text (page content) and RCS histories; |

TWiki is written in *Perl 5* and also uses some *shell commands*. It also requires that *GNU RCS* (Revision Control System) is installed on the same system. The current implementation runs best on a Linux machine, but it can also run with Microsoft Windows.

TWiki is written in *Perl 5* and also uses some *shell commands*. The current implementation runs best on a Unix machine, but it is also possible on Microsoft Windows. *RCS* (for revision control) must be installed on the system. [ __MM: Locate elsewhere and/or include one-liner and link for RCS...__ ]

---+++ Directory Structure
d22 1
a22 1
You can easily rename the root TWiki directory - ==twiki== - to whatever you like by changing it in the ==twiki.cfg== configuration file. However, to keep the current installation and future upgrades simple, you should leave the subdirectory structure - the folder names and locations - exactly as is:

| ==twiki/lib/TWiki== |  [[#LibTWiki][list]]  | Perl modules |
| ==twiki/lib/TWiki/Plugins== |  [[#libtwikiplugins][list]]  | TWikiPlugins Perl modules |
