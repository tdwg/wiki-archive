---++ FAQ:

Why does the topic revision not increase when I edit a topic?

---++ Answer:

The same topic revision will be used when you save a topic again within a certain time frame (one hour by default). This is to prevent unnecessary topic revisions when you do several edit cycles in a row. Note that a new revision __is__ created if another person edits the same topic, regardless of the time.
