---+!! Welcome, %WIKIUSERNAME%!

Welcome to <nop>%WIKITOOLNAME%! This is a TWikiSite (pronounced _twee-kee site_), a meeting place to work on common interests. Anyone can contribute using any web browser. <nop>%WIKITOOLNAME% looks like a normal web site... except that it encourages contribution and *editing* of pages, questions, answers, comments and updates.

"Wiki" systems are fundamentally editable web pages.  It's a fun and useful way of communicating asynchronously over the web for many existing intranet and public Internet sites.  TWiki is simple to learn and use.  It aims to provide a transparent way for you to publish and exchange your ideas with others over the web.

%TOC%

---++ What's in a TWiki?

   * *Webs:* A TWikiSite is divided into webs, each one represents an area for collaboration. This site has the following webs: %WEBLIST{ format="[[$name.%HOMETOPIC%][$name]]" separator=", " }%
   * *Topics:* Each web is made up of hyperlinked [[TWikiTopics][topics]] that appear in your browser.

---++ Some things to do

   * *Browse.* This is a site like other sites. Read and follow interesting links.
   * *Write.* Speak your mind! From your browser you can change or add to anything you see in a TWiki topic. Use regular text or TWikiShorthand.
   * *Experiment.*  Edit your personal page or visit the Sandbox.%HOMETOPIC% web.
   * *Organize.* You can learn to use TWikiForms and [[FormattedSearch]]es to include topic information - for example, classify pages by subject, status, or date.
   * *Learn more.* Some good places to start:
      * TWikiTutorial is a 20-minute tour of TWiki essentials. 
      * ATasteOfTWiki is a short introduction training course for beginners. 
      * WikiReferences links to selected articles and books about wiki technology and online collaboration.
      * WikiSyntax - simple syntax for edits
      * GoodStyle - recommendations for edits

 
---++ Some basics

---+++ Editing a page:
   * click ==Edit== at the bottom of any topic and make your changes
   * click ==[&nbsp;Preview&nbsp;Changes&nbsp;]== at the bottom to verify the topic (use your brower's ==Back== button if necessary)
   * click ==[&nbsp;Save&nbsp;Changes&nbsp;]== You've now edited the topic!

---+++ Creating a page

See a question mark link "<u>?</u>" behind a !WikiWord? That means that there's no topic yet for that TWikiWord. If you want to create a topic for that !WikiWord, just click on the question mark. The topic will be created and you will be in the editor window.
 
---+++ Viewing the history of a topic

Click ==History== at the bottom of a topic

---+++ Attaching files

Click ==Attach== to upload and attach any type of file.

<H3>Welcome, %WIKIUSERNAME%!</H3>
d4 5
a8 1
You have reached a TWikiSite (pronounced _twee-kee site_). TWiki is a meeting place where people collaborate on common interests. Anyone can contribute using a regular Web browser. TWiki looks like a normal Web site, but it allows (and encourages) everyone to *freely edit the pages* by contributing questions, answers, comments, changes - ideas can be transformed into published input, instantly. TWiki is very simple to learn and use, and provides possibly the most powerful way to exchange and develop ideas online, in an open, uncomplicated environment.
d12 50
a61 48
	1. *Read:* You can treat this site like any other. Browse, and follow interesting links. A couple of hints:
		* *web:* A TWikiSite is divided into webs; each one represents one subject, one area of collaboration. You can reach any web from the links in the upper right corner of every page.
		* *topic:* Each web is made up of hyperlinked topics - TWikiTopics that appear in your browser.
		* *What's new:* Visit WebChanges in any TWiki web to see what other people are discussing and what's been added most recently.
	1. *Create an Account:* To be able to write new content on this site, you'll need to create an account for yourself. It's simple, and only takes a minute: just visit TWikiRegistration and fill out the form. This will also create your personal home page.
	1. *Write:* If you have something to say, speak your mind! Anyone can change or add to anything they see written in a TWiki topic. You can edit a topic from within your browser, using TWikiShorthand, a very simple markup language (you can also use HTML if you like, but you'll usually find you can get the same results more easily with TWikiShorthand). To contribute:
		* click the ==Edit== link at the bottom of the page, edit the text, and then
		* click the ==[&nbsp;Preview&nbsp;Changes&nbsp;]== button at the bottom of the page to see what your topic will look like (use your brower's ==Back== button if you want to make changes), and finally
		* click the ==[&nbsp;Save&nbsp;Changes&nbsp;]== to save what you did.
	1. *Do you find this...scary?!* Anybody can do anything! That's not how things are usually done. It's...uncontrollable. And yet, collaborating in the Wiki way works! Try it out for even a couple of minutes. Take a look at WikiCulture. (And then, with TWiki, you can define fine-grained TWikiAccessControl, based on users and groups, whenever and wherever you feel its necessary, across a site, a web, or page by page, if you like. And there's also full revision control that retains all changes, for good measure!)
	1. *Experiment:* To get your virtual hands dirty, visit [[Sandbox.%HOMETOPIC%][Sandbox]] web, where you can try out anything at all, in a consequence-free environment!
	1. *Create a link:* To link to another topic, start by editing an existing topic.
		* To create a link to a topic that already exists, type its ==JoinCapitalizedWords== name (topics are automatically linked if they are WikiWords, names composed of two or more words with initial capitals, run together).
		* To create a link to a page that does not yet exist, make up and enter a ==NeverBeforeUsedPhrase==. You are encouraged to include WikiWords in your content, for others to fill out later.
		* When you've saved the topic, and redisplayed it, the references to existing topics will be linked and the references to topics that don't exist will be followed by a linked "<u>?</u>" (question mark).
	1. *Create a topic:*
		* To write something up for a new topic, click on the "<u>?</u>" (question mark) that follows a WikiWord.
		* To create a free-floating topic - a topic that is not linked from anywhere - type its WikiWord in the entry field at the top of any page. If the topic already exists you'll then be taken to it. If it doesn't exist, you'll then have the option to create it.
	1. *See the history of a topic:* Click the ==Diffs== link on the control strip at the bottom of every page to see a complete history of edits for that topic.
	1. *Attach files:* Use your browser to upload and attach any type of file to a topic using the ==Attach== link at the bottom of the page.
	1. *Organize:* Use TWikiForms to include specific information with individual topics - for example, classify pages by subject, status, or date.
	1. *Learn more*: TWikiTutorial takes you on a 20-minute tour of the TWiki essentials. WikiReferences links to selected articles and books about online collaboration, and Wiki technology in particular.

*Main Features of TWiki*

	* Create and edit pages, and use all other features, through any Web browser.
	* Web pages are automatically linked. You do not need to learn HTML commands to link pages.
	* Very simple text formatting. Basically, you write a page the same way you would write an email.
	* Fast, full-text search with or without regular expressions.
	* All changes to pages and attachments are under revision control. Find out who changed what and when.
	* Fine-grained access control based on users and groups.
	* Automatic email notification when pages change.
	* File attachments: Upload and download any file as an attachment to a page, using your browser. This is similar to email file attachments, but it happens on web pages.
	* Topic locking: Users are warned if a page is being edited by another person, to avoid simultaneous page editing.
	* Templates and skins: Customize every possible aspect of the look and feel of each TWiki installation, down to the individual page level.
	* Plugins: A growing collection of plugins allows you to easily add optional extended functions, or to create your own.
	* Support: An active, helpful development community keeps TWiki support and development constantly moving forward.
	* __Read more__ about the TWiki at http://TWiki.org/ .

*Starting Points in the %TWIKIWEB% web*

	* *[[TWikiTutorial]]*: Familiarize yourself with TWiki before you start editing content.
	* %HOMETOPIC%: Entry point for this web.
	* TWikiSite: Explains what a TWiki site is.
	* GoodStyle: Things to consider when changing text.
	* WikiSyntax: Easy to learn rules for editing text.
	* WebChanges: Newest topic changes in the %WEB% web.
	* TWikiRegistration: *Sign up so you can use edit* and other features.

Welcome %WIKIUSERNAME%,
d4 1
a4 1
You have reached a TWikiSite (pronounced twee-kee site). TWiki is a meeting place where people collaborate on common interests. Anyone can contribute using a regular Web browser. TWiki looks like a normal Web site, but it allows (and ecourages) everyone to *edit the web pages* and contribute their questions and input. It really is very simple to learn and use, and provides possibly the most powerful way to exchange and develop ideas online, in an open, uncomplicated environment.

	1. *Write:* If you have something to say, speak your mind! Anyone can change or add to anything they see written in a TWiki topic. You can edit a topic from within your browser, using TWikiShorthand, a very simple markup language (you can also use HTML if you like, but you'll usually find you can get the same results more easily with TWikiShorthand). To contribute,
		* click the =Edit= link at the bottom of the page, edit the text, and then
		* click the =[&nbsp;Preview&nbsp;Changes&nbsp;]= button at the bottom of the page to see what your topic will look like (use the BACK button on your browser to go back and fix something.), and finally
		* click the =[&nbsp;Save&nbsp;Changes&nbsp;]= to save what you did.
	1. *But this is scary!* Anybody can do anything! The concept at first may seem...strange. Uncontrollable. And yet, collaborating the Wiki way works! See WikiCulture. (You can define fine-grained TWikiAccessControl based on users groups if really necessary, and there's full revision control that retains all changes!)
	1. *Experiment:* To get your virtual hands dirty, visit Test.%HOMETOPIC% in the %WIKITOOLNAME%.Test web.
d20 2
a21 2
		* To create a link to a topic that already exists, type its =JoinCapitalizedWords= name (topics are automatically linked if they are WikiWords, names composed of two or more words with initial capitals, run together).
		* To create a link to a page that does not yet exist, make up and enter a =NeverBeforeUsedPhrase=. You are encouraged to include WikiWords in your content, for others to fill out later.

	1. *Learn more*: TWikiTutorial takes you on a 20-minute tour of the TWiki essentials. WikiReferences has links to articles and books about online collaboration and Wiki technology in particular.

a13 6
	1. *Read:* You can treat this web site like any other. Just read and follow interesting links.
		* *Web:* %WIKITOOLNAME% is divided up into webs; each one represents one area of collaboration. The webs are accessible at the upper right corner.
		* *Topic:* Each web has hyper-linked topics. A topic is one web page in your browser.
		* *What's New:* Visit WebChanges in any %WIKITOOLNAME% web to see what other people are doing here and what is currently being discussed.
	1. *Create an Account:* Before you'll be able to write new content on this site you'll need to create an account for yourself. Its simple, and only takes a minute. Just visit TWikiRegistration and fill out the form. This will also create your personal home page.
	1. *Write:* If you have something to say, you can and should (most of the time). Anyone can change or add to anything they see written in a %WIKITOOLNAME% topic. You can edit a topic from within your browser, using WikiSyntax, a very simple markup language (you could also use HTML if you wish, but this is optional). To contribute,

	1. *Create a Link:* To link to another topic, start by editing an existing topic.
		* To create a link to a topic that already exists, type its =JoinCapitalizedWords= name (topics are automatically linked if they are WikiWords, e.g. names composed of two or more words with initial capitals, run together).
		* To create a link to a page that does not yet exist, make up and type a =NeverBeforeUsedPhrase=. You are encouraged to include WikiWords in your content, for others to fill out later.
		* When you have saved the topic, and redisplayed it, the references to existing topics will be linked and the references to topics that don't exist will be followed by a linked "<u>?</u>" (question mark).
	1. *Create a Topic:*
d25 5
a29 5
		* To create a free-floating topic, e.g. a topic that is not linked from anywhere, type its WikiWord in the entry field at the top of any page. If the topic already exists you'll then be taken to it. If it doesn't exist, you'll then have the option to create it.
	1. *See the History of a Topic:* Check out the the various "Diff" entries at the bottom of page.
	1. *Attach Files:* Upload and attach any file to a topic by following the "Attach" link at the bottom of page.
	1. *Forms:* Use forms in topics to capture specific information e.g. for use in FAQs or bug tracking - see TWikiForms

*How %WIKITOOLNAME% Works*

%WIKITOOLNAME% is divided up into *webs* ; each one represents one area of collaboration. The webs are accessible at the upper right corner. Our %WIKITOOLNAME% webs:

%INCLUDE{"TWikiWebsTable"}%

Each web has hyper-linked topics. A *topic* is one web page in your browser.

To browse this %WIKITOOLNAME% site, just click on any highlighted link. These links are called WikiWords, and comprise two or more words with initial capitals, run together. 

To edit any topic, click on "Edit" at the bottom of the topic. You can edit the topic from within your browser, using WikiSyntax, a very simple markup language. You could also use HTML if you wish, but this is optional. (Before you can edit pages you need to register in TWikiRegistration.)

A highlighted "?" following a WikiTopic means that no content has yet been entered for that topic. You are invited to add some content by clicking on the "?". You are encouraged to include WikiWords in your content, for others to fill out later.

Please follow the TWikiTutorial to get you up to speed on TWiki. You can use the <a href="../Test/WebHome">%WIKITOOLNAME%.Test</a> web for testing.
