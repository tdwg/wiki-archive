%SHORTDESCRIPTION%

Support for the integration of WYSIWYG (What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get) editors. On its own, the only thing this plugin gives you is a stand-alone HTML to TWiki translator script. For WYSIWYG editing in TWiki, you will also need to install a specific editor package such as TWiki:Plugins.KupuEditorContrib or TWiki:Plugins.WikiwygContrib.

This plugin provides a generic framework that supports editing of TWiki topics using any browser-based HTML editor. It works by transforming TML (TWiki Meta Language) into HTML for the editor, and then transforming HTML back into TML on save.

---++ Features
	* Supports the input of malformed HTML
	* Full round-trip (TML -> XHTML -> TWiki syntax)
	* Framework is editor-agnostic

---++ Details
---+++ What's in the package
The package includes the following pieces:
	* TML (TWiki syntax) to HTML translator
	* HTML to TML translator (with stand-alone script)
	* Generic TWiki plugin for automating the translation during editing

---+++ How it works
The plugin works by translating the topic text into HTML when someone edits a topic. The HTML is then fed to the WYSIWYG editor. On save, the edited HTML is run through the reverse translation before saving to the topic. TWiki syntax is used in preference to HTML in the stored topic wherever possible, though HTML may be used if the translator can't find a suitable TML equivalent..

The default rendering that TWiki uses to generate HTML for display in browsers is 'lossy' - information in the TWiki syntax is lost in the HTML output, and a round-trip (recovering the original TWiki syntax from the HTML) is impossible. To solve this problem the plugin instead uses its own translation of TWiki syntax to pure XHTML. The generated XHTML is annotated with CSS classes that support the accurate recovery of the original TWiki syntax.

_Before you ask the obvious question, yes, the translator *could* be used to replace the TWiki rendering pipeline for generating HTML pages. In fact, the translator is taken almost directly from the implementation of the rendering pipeline for the TWiki-4 release_

Translation of the HTML back to TWiki syntax uses the CPAN:HTML::Parser. This parser is used in preference to a more modern XML parser, because the HTML may not generate fully compliant XHTML. A strict parser would risk losing content. CPAN:HTML::Parser is better at handling malformed HTML.

There is also the advantage that the translator can be used to import HTML from other sources - for example, existing web pages. Due to the simple nature of TWiki syntax and the potential complexity of web pages, this translation is often lossy - i.e there will be HTML features that can be entered by editors that will be lost in this translation step. This is especially noticeable with HTML tables.

---+++ Using the translators from Perl scripts

Both translators can be used directly from Perl scripts, for example to build your own stand-alone translators.

A stand-alone convertor script for HTML to TWiki is included in the installation. It can be found in the top-level =tools= directory and is called =html2tml.pl=.

---+++ Integrating a Wysiwyg Editor
The plugin can be used to generate HTML for an editor in two ways; first, by generating the HTML for the content-to-be-edited directly in the edit template, and second, through a URL that can be used to fetch the content-to-be-edited from the server.

---++++ Getting content in the edit template
This is the scenario used by the standard TWiki text editor, except that the text is pre-converted to HTML before inclusion in the template.

The flow of control is as follows:
   1 User hits "edit".
   1 The =beforeEditHandler= filters the edit, blocking any attempt to edit restricted content
   1 The =edit= template containing the JS editor is instantiated. The following variables are available for expansion in the template:
      * =%<nop>WYSIWYG_TEXT%= expands to the HTML of the content-to-be-edited. This is suitable for use in a =textarea=.
      * =%<nop>JAVASCRIPT_TEXT%= expands to the HTML of the content-to-be-edited in a javascript constant.

=WYSIWYGPLUGIN_WYSIWYGSKIN= *must* be set for this to work.

---++++ Fetching content from a URL
In this scenario, the edit template is generated *without* the content-to-be-edited. The content is retrieved from the server using a URL e.g. from an =IFRAME= or using a =XmlHttpRequest=.

The flow of control is as follows:
   1 User hits "edit".
   1 If the current skin = =WYWIWYGPLUGIN_WYWIWYGSKIN=, the =beforeEditHandler=
      filters the edit, blocking any attempt to edit restricted content.
   1 The =edit= template containing the JS editor is instantiated.
   1 JS editor invokes content URL to obtain the HTML document to be edited
      * The content URL is just a TWiki =view= URL with the =wysiwyg_edit=
        parameter set.
      * The plugin recognises the =wysiwyg_edit= parameter and uses the
        TML2HTML translator to prepare the text, which is then returned
        as =text/plain= to the browser.
      * Two TWiki variables, =%<nop>OWEB%= and %<nop>OTOPIC%=, should be used in
        the content URL to refer to the source topic for the content.

---+++ Handling Saves
Saves are invoked by the editor POSTing to the TWiki =save= script with the =wysiwyg_edit=
parameter set to =1=. This parameter tells the =beforeSaveHandler= in the plugin to convert the HTML back to TML. See %TWIKIWEB%.TWikiScripts for details of the other parameters to the =save= script.

Once the save script has completed it responds with a redirect, either to an Oops page if the save failed, or to the appropriate post-save URL (usually a =view=). The editor must be ready to handle this redirect.

---++++ Handling Attachments
Attachment uploads can be handled by URL requests from the editor to the TWiki
=upload= script. The =upload= script normally redirects to the containing topic; a behaviour that you usually don't want in an editor! There are two ways to handle this:
   * If the uploads are done in an =IFRAME= or via =XmlHttpRequest=, then the
     302 redirect at the end of the upload can simply be ignored.
   * You can pass =noredirect= to the =upload= script to suppress the redirect. In this case
     you will get a =text/plain= response of =OK= followed by a message if everything went well, or an error message if it did not.

---++ Plugin Installation Instructions
You do not need to install anything in the browser to use this extension. The following instructions are for the administrator who installs the extension on the server where TWiki is running.

Like many other TWiki extensions, this module is shipped with a fully automatic installer script written using the Build<nop>Contrib.
   * If you have TWiki 4.1 or later, and Perl 5.8, you can install from the =configure= interface (Go to Plugins->Find More Extensions)
      * The webserver user has to have permission to write to all areas of your installation for this to work.
   * If you have a permanent connection to the internet (and Perl 5.8), you are recommended to use the automatic installer script
      * Just download the =WysiwygPlugin_installer= perl script and run it.
   * *Notes:*
      * The installer script will:
         * Automatically resolve dependencies,
         * Copy files into the right places in your local install (even if you have renamed data directories),
         * check in new versions of any installed files that have existing RCS histories files in your existing install (such as topics).
         * If the $TWIKI_PACKAGES environment variable is set to point to a directory, the installer will try to get archives from there. Otherwise it will try to download from twiki.org or cpan.org, as appropriate.
         * (Developers only: the script will look for twikiplugins/WysiwygPlugin/WysiwygPlugin.tgz before downloading from TWiki.org)
      * If you don't have a permanent connection, you can still use the automatic installer, by downloading all required TWiki archives to a local directory.
         * Point the environment variable =$TWIKI_PACKAGES= to this directory, and the installer script will look there first for required TWiki packages.
            * =$TWIKI_PACKAGES= is actually a path; you can list several directories separated by :
         * If you are behind a firewall that blocks access to CPAN, you can build a local CPAN mini-mirror, as described at http://twiki.org/cgi-bin/view/Codev/BuildingDakar#CPAN_local_minimirror
   * If you don't want to use the installer script, or have problems on your platform (e.g. you don't have Perl 5.8), then you can still install manually:
      1 Download and unpack one of the =.zip= or =.tgz= archives to a temporary directory.
      1 Manually copy the contents across to the relevant places in your TWiki installation.
      1 Check in any installed files that have existing =,v= files in your existing install (take care *not* to lock the files when you check in)
      1 Manually edit !LocalSite.cfg to set any configuration variables.
      1 Run =configure= and enable the module, if it is a plugin.
      1 Repeat from step 1 for any missing dependencies.


---++ Plugin Configuration Settings

---+++ Translator control
For any of the following controls to work, you must tell %TOPIC% the name of
the skin being used to invoke the Wysiwyg editor, for example =kupu= or =wikiwyg=.
	* Set WYSIWYGSKIN =
Note that is can be set differently in different areas by defining
=WYSWIYGPLUGIN_WYSIWYGSKIN= locally (e.g. in !WebPreferences).

The *global* TWiki Variable =WYSIWYG_EXCLUDE= can be set to make the plugin sensitive to what is in a topic before allowing it to be edited. You can set it up to refuse to edit if 
   * some or all of HTML tags (e.g. =&lt;br /&gt;= or =&lt;div&gt;=), or 
   * simple variables (e.g. =%<nop>VAR%=) or 
   * calls (e.g. =%<nop>VARIABLE{...}%=)
   * PRE blocks (=&lt;pre&gt;=)
   * HTML comments (=&lt;!--= ... =--&gt;=)
   
are used in the topic. If the plugin detects an excluded construct in the topic, it will redirect to the default editor. Comma-separated list of one or more of =html=, =variables=, =calls=, =pre= or =comments= e.g.
   * Set WYSIWYG_EXCLUDE = calls,html
Set =WYSIWYG_EXCLUDE= in %MAINWEB%.TWikiPreferences, or in %WEBPREFSTOPIC% for each web.

If you excluded =calls= in =WYSIWYG_EXCLUDE=, you can still define a subset of TWiki variables that do *not* block edits. this is done in the *global* preference variable =WYSIWYG_EDITABLE_CALLS=, which should be a list of TWiki variable names separated by vertical bars, with no spaces, e.g:
   * Set WYSIWYG_EDITABLE_CALLS = COMMENT|CALENDAR|INCLUDE

---++ Known issues

---+++ Incompatible with "non-standard" syntax
WysiwygPlugin is incompatible with plugins that expand non-standard syntax e.g. TWiki:Plugins.MathModePlugin (WysiwygPlugin)

Plugins that extend the syntax using TWiki variables, such as =%MYVARIABLE%=, should work fine.

---+++ Overlapping styles
Because TWiki uses a "best guess" approach to some formatting, it allows overlapping of tags in a way forbidden by HTML, and it is impossible to guarantee 100% that formating in the original TWiki document will still be there when the same document is loaded and then saved through the WysiwygPlugin. The most obvious case of this is to do with styles. For example, the sentence
<verbatim>
*bold _bold-italic* italic_
</verbatim>
is legal in TML, but in HTML is represented by
<verbatim>
<strong>bold <em>bold-italic</em></strong> <em>italic</em>
</verbatim>
which gets translated back to TML as
<verbatim>
*bold _bold-italic_* _italic_
</verbatim>
which is correct by construction, but does not render correctly in TWiki. This problem is unfortunately unavoidable due to the way TWiki syntax works.
