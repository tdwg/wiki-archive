---+!! Template Web

---++ Purpose

Template webs were created to act as templates in creating webs.  It is now possible to create webs via the %TWIKIWEB%.ManagingWebs topic.  In the not so distant past TWiki webs were created by hand.  The data directory contains the different webs such as *Main* and *TWiki*.  A web that begins with an underscore &quot;_&quot; character is considered invisible and a template.  All files in the *_default* (or any other web that begins with an underscore) template web will be copied into your new web.  The [[_default.%HOMETOPIC%][_default]] web template contains the following topics: =<nop>%HOMETOPIC%, <nop>WebChanges, <nop>WebIndex, <nop>WebNotify, <nop>WebPreferences, <nop>WebSearch, <nop>WebStatistics and <nop>WebTopicList.=

---++ Customizing

The web template is useful for administrators to design for creating webs of a certain type.  Departmental webs can at least begin with a similar look and feel.

Simply create a web with an underscore for the first character.  These can be used by authorized users to create webs from this template.
