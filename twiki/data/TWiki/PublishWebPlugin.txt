---+!! Publish Web Plugin

Utility to publish a TWiki web to static HTML pages. Useful to maintain a static website collaboratively in an access restricted TWiki.

%TOC%

---++ Description and Syntax Rules

One web (defined in the PUBLISHWEBNAME setting) serves as the master for the static HTML pages. The Plugin generates an HTML pages every time a user saves a topic in the Publish web. The static HTML files are based on a TWiki skin of choice. All referred attachments (images etc) are copied to a publish directory.

---+++ Topics and Links
   * The home topic is assumed to be =Index=
   * Topic names: For clarity, use capitalized words and underscores (%TWIKIWEB%.WikiWord names are possible too)
   * All links should be defined as double square bracket links, e.g. =[<nop>[Topic]]= or =[<nop>[Topic][label]]= (do not use %TWIKIWEB%.WikiWord links)

#PublishProcess
---+++ Publish process
<form action="%SCRIPTURL%/view%SCRIPTSUFFIX%/%WEB%/%TOPIC%#PublishProcess">
   * A static HTML page is generated for exery topic saved in the %PUBLISHWEBNAME% web (unless listed in the EXCLUDETOPIC setting)
   * Topic names get converted to a lowercase filename, e.g. =Index= to =index.html=, =AboutUs= to =aboutus.html=, and =Customer_Support= to =customer_support.html=
   * Only text between =%<nop>STARTPUBLISH%= and =%<nop>STOPPUBLISH%= is used (the whole text if missing)
   * !WikiWord links are ignored, also across webs
   * Page layout is based on the skin defined in the PUBLISHSKIN setting
   * Topics can be re-published without an edit/save cycle.%BR%
     Topic:
     <select name="tname">
     <option value="">select...</option>
     <option>all</option>
     %TOPICLIST{ web="%PUBLISHWEBNAME%" format="<option>$name</option>" separator=" " }% </select>
     <input type="hidden" name="action" value="publish" />
     <input type="submit" value="Publish" />
     [[%SCRIPTURL%/view%SCRIPTSUFFIX%/%WEB%/%TOPIC%#PublishProcess][Clear]]%BR%
     %PUBLISHWEB{ "%URLPARAM{ "action" }%" topic="%URLPARAM{ "tname" }%" }%
</form>

---+++ Variables
   * =%<nop>STARTPUBLISH%= - place in topic text where to start publishing
      * Optional, start from top if missing
   * =%<nop>STOPPUBLISH%= - place in topic text where to stop publishing
      * Optional, publish to end of topic if missing
   * =%<nop>PUBLISHWEB{"nicetopic"}%= - nice topic name
      * Shows a "nice" topic name of the current topic: Underscores in topic names are rendered as space; the Index topic is rendered with the HOMELABEL Plugin setting
      * Example: Topic =Customer_Support= turns into =Customer Support=
   * =%<nop>PUBLISHWEB{"breadcrumb"}%= - nice breadcrumb
      * The breadcrumb is based on the parent child relationship of topics, starting at the Index topic
      * The breadcrumb does _not_ include the current topic, append =%<nop>PUBLISHWEB{"nicetopic"}%= to get the complete breadcrumb
      * The skin may contain a =%<nop>PUBLISHWEB{"breadcrumb"}%= variable to show the breadcrumb
      * Underscores in topic names are rendered as space
      * Example: =You are here: <u>Home</u> &gt; <u>Customer Support</u> &gt;=
   * =%<nop>PUBLISHWEB{"publish" topic="Name"}%= - re-publish topic(s) without edit/save cycle
      * Useful to refresh all HTML pages if the skin has been modified
      * A =topic="all"= publishes all topics in the Publish web except for the excluded ones
      * A =topic="Any_Topic"= publishes a specific topics

      * Configuration on shell level:
         * Settings in =lib/TWiki/Plugins/%TOPIC%.pm=: For security, the output directories are defined in the =%TOPIC%.pm= library. Change the hardcoded settings if needed:
            * =$publishPath= defines the output directory of the static HTML files, __relative to__ the =twiki/pub= directory; defaults to the parent directory of the =twiki/pub= directory; should point to the htdocs root directory
            * =$attachPath= defaults =_publish=; is __relative to__ =$publishPath=
         * Create the directory indicated in the =$attachPath= setting
         * Change the permission of directories indicated by =$publishPath= and =$attachPath= to be writable by the cgi user (typically user =nobody=)
      * Create new TWiki web for website publishing:
         * Create a new =Publish= web (name indicated by the =PUBLISHWEBNAME= Plugin setting)
         * In !WebPreferences of that web, set the =NOAUTOLINK= setting to =on=
         * For convenience, add these links to the WebLeftBar:
            * =*Publishing*=
            * =[<nop>[Index][Home page topic]]=
            * =[<nop>[http://%<nop>HTTP_HOST%/index.html][/index.html]]=
            * =[<nop>[http://%<nop>HTTP_HOST%%<nop>PUBLISHWEB{topicurl}%][%<nop>PUBLISHWEB{topicurl}%]]=
            * =[<nop>[%<nop>SCRIPTURL%/view%<nop>SCRIPTSUFFIX%/%<nop>WEB%/WebPublish?\%BR%action=publish;ptopic=%<nop>BASETOPIC%][Re-publish this topic]]=
            * =[<nop>[%<nop>TWIKIWEB%.PublishWebPlugin][PublishWebPlugin]]=
         * Create an =Test= topic in that web
         * This should generate an =test.html= page on topic save
         * Create =Index= topic and other topics
   * Publish skin:
      * Create a new publish skin based on your branding. The [[%TWIKIWEB%.TWikiSkins][TWiki skin]] can be derived from any =twiki/templates/view.*.tmpl= skin file
      * Omit any links to TWiki, such as edit and attach links
      * The skin can use Plugin specific settings =%<nop>PUBLISHWEB{"breadcrumb"}%= and =%<nop>PUBLISHWEB{"nicetopic"}%=
      * The skin can introduce skin specific [[Publish.WebPreferences]] settings, such as =%<nop>PUBLISH_SITE%=, =%<nop>PUBLISH_LOGO%=, etc.
      * Activate the new skin in the Plugin's =PUBLISHSKIN= setting

---++ Limitations

   * All attachments are copied into the same directory, e.g. make sure you use unique filenames across all topics in your publish web and in your skin
