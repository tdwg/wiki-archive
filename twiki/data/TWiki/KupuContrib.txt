%SHORTDESCRIPTION%

<img src="%ATTACHURL%/screenshot.jpg" alt="Screenshot" />

%TOC%

The integration uses the TWiki:Plugins.WysiwygPlugin to translate text to and from a format that Kupu can edit.

*Caveat*: %TOPIC% is designed for editing TWiki topics, not as a general purpose HTML editor. It will work fine on topics that contain text, TML formatting, and most HTML. However, because of the complexity of transforming TML into HTML and back, complex TML, and mixing HTML and TML may not give the results you expect. You are recommended to use the standard browser textarea editor for editing existing topics that contain mixed HTML and TML, or complex %<nop>TML%-type variables.

---++ How to use the editor
Basic help for most of the functions in the toolbar is available by "hovering" the mouse over the button. 
Some functions require a bit more explanation:
	* "Insert No-Op" inserts a &lt;nop> region. Any TWiki syntax such as wikiwords or variables inside the region will be disabled in the rgeion. $lt;nop> regions may not extend over line breaks.
	* The rightmost drop-down will give you a menu of TWiki variables that can be inserted. Any of these variables can be edited after they have been placed in the text, for example to add parameters.
	* "Insert a WikiWord" will give you a menu of topics in the _current web_ that can be inserted. Topics are inserted as links, though typing wikiwords in plain text will work just as well.
   * Watch out for the &lt;&gt; button on the right of the toolbar. It lets you switch into an HTML view, which can be very useful when you can't get your formatting right.
   * In TWiki, a totally empty table cell causes the cell to be merged with the cell immediately to the left. To make this effect more transparent in the editor, these empty cells are shown with the text "%<nop>SPAN%" in them. In Kupu, if you add %<nop>SPAN% to a table cell, then all the rest of the content will be thrown away and the cell will be converted to an empty table cell. Note that this only applies to tables that are converted to TWiki syntax.

---++ Kupu Notes
The version of Kupu shipped with this plugin is an uncustomised basic Kupu release. All the TWikification is done as plugins and extensions to Kupu - the basic kupu code is shipped completely intact.

---++ Installation Instructions

You do not need to install anything in the browser to use this extension. The following instructions are for the administrator who installs the extension on the server where TWiki is running.

Like many other TWiki extensions, this module is shipped with a fully automatic installer script written using the Build<nop>Contrib.
   * If you have TWiki 4.1 or later, and Perl 5.8, you can install from the =configure= interface (Go to Plugins->Find More Extensions)
      * The webserver user has to have permission to write to all areas of your installation for this to work.
   * If you have a permanent connection to the internet (and Perl 5.8), you are recommended to use the automatic installer script
      * Just download the =KupuContrib_installer= perl script and run it.
   * *Notes:*
      * The installer script will:
         * Automatically resolve dependencies,
         * Copy files into the right places in your local install (even if you have renamed data directories),
         * check in new versions of any installed files that have existing RCS histories files in your existing install (such as topics).
         * If the $TWIKI_PACKAGES environment variable is set to point to a directory, the installer will try to get archives from there. Otherwise it will try to download from twiki.org or cpan.org, as appropriate.
         * (Developers only: the script will look for twikiplugins/KupuContrib/KupuContrib.tgz before downloading from TWiki.org)
      * If you don't have a permanent connection, you can still use the automatic installer, by downloading all required TWiki archives to a local directory.
         * Point the environment variable =$TWIKI_PACKAGES= to this directory, and the installer script will look there first for required TWiki packages.
            * =$TWIKI_PACKAGES= is actually a path; you can list several directories separated by :
         * If you are behind a firewall that blocks access to CPAN, you can build a local CPAN mini-mirror, as described at http://twiki.org/cgi-bin/view/Codev/BuildingDakar#CPAN_local_minimirror
   * If you don't want to use the installer script, or have problems on your platform (e.g. you don't have Perl 5.8), then you can still install manually:
      1 Download and unpack one of the =.zip= or =.tgz= archives to a temporary directory.
      1 Manually copy the contents across to the relevant places in your TWiki installation.
      1 Check in any installed files that have existing =,v= files in your existing install (take care *not* to lock the files when you check in)
      1 Manually edit !LocalSite.cfg to set any configuration variables.
      1 Run =configure= and enable the module, if it is a plugin.
      1 Repeat from step 1 for any missing dependencies.


*Do not forget to enable the WysiwygPlugin in =configure= or it won't work*.
	* To enable the editor in one of your skins, add the following link to the skin alongside or in place of the existing 'edit' link:<br /><code>&lt;a href="%<nop>SCRIPTURLPATH%/edit%<nop>SCRIPTSUFFIX%/%<nop>WEB%/%<nop>TOPIC%?skin=kupu"&gt;Kupu&lt;/a&gt;</code><br />As you can see this is just a standard edit link with the 'kupu' skin in place of the usual edit skin. Here it is for this topic: <a href="%SCRIPTURLPATH%/edit%SCRIPTSUFFIX%/%WEB%/%TOPIC%?skin=kupu">Kupu</a>. Try clicking on it, but _do not save_!

If you are using TWiki-4.0.0 or later with =pattern= skin, the =%<nop>COMPOSER%= global TWiki variable is used to control the skin used for the WYSIWYG editor link. You can define this variable to the empty string to disable WYSIWYG editing on a site, per-web, per-user or per-topic basis. Set =COMPOSER= to =kupu= to enable this module.

---++ Other Settings
See also: WysiwygPlugin for other settings that affect this contrib. Note
especially the =WYSIWYGSKIN=, which should be set to =kupu= for this contrib
to work correctly.

The editor template includes a number of files that can be used for other settings. These files are *not* included in the distribution, so that you can easily create your own local content.

---+++ %TWIKIWEB%.<nop>WysiwygPluginIcons
You can define a list of icons that will be available in the Kupu editor when the %ATTACHURL%/smiley.png toolbar button is pressed. This topic has to contain a list of &lt;IMG&gt; tags. If present, the 'alt' text will be used in place of the &lt;IMG&gt; tag when translating from HTML to TML. Example:
<verbatim>
	<img src="%PUBURL%/TWiki/TWikiDocGraphics/tip.gif" />
	<img src="%PUBURL%/TWiki/TWikiDocGraphics/warning.gif" />
	<img src="%PUBURL%/TWiki/TWikiDocGraphics/pencil.gif" />
	<img src="%PUBURL%/TWiki/TWikiDocGraphics/choice-yes.gif" />
	<img src="%PUBURL%/TWiki/TWikiDocGraphics/updated.gif" />
	<img src="%PUBURL%/TWiki/TWikiDocGraphics/help.gif" />
	<img src="%PUBURL%/TWiki/TWikiDocGraphics/new.gif" />
	<img src="%PUBURL%/TWiki/TWikiDocGraphics/starred.gif" />
	<img src="%PUBURL%/TWiki/TWikiDocGraphics/arrowright.gif" />
</verbatim>

---+++ %TWIKIWEB%.<nop>WysiwygPluginStrings
You can also define a list of strings that will be available for insertion in topics using the %ATTACHURL%/strings.png toolbar button. This topic has to contain a list of HTML 'option' tags. Example:
<verbatim>
	<option value='-- <nop>%WIKIUSERNAME% - %DATE%'>Signature</option>
	<option value="%<nop>WIKINAME%">Wiki name (variable)</option>
	<option value='%<nop>SEARCH{"search for"}%'>Inline search (variable)</option>
	<option value='%<nop>INCLUDE{"topic or url"}%'>Include (variable)</option>
	<option value="%<nop>TOC%"> Table of Contents (variable)</option>
	<option value="%<nop>TOPIC%">Topic (variable)</option>
	<option value="%<nop>WEB%">Web (variable)</option>
	<option value="%<nop>DATE%"> Date (variable)</option>
</verbatim>
The bit between the &gt; &lt; =value= defines text in the drop-down box in the editor, and the =value= defines the actual string inserted in the topic.			
---+++ %TWIKIWEB%.<nop>WysiwygPluginLocalHelp
If it exists, the contents of this topic will be included and shown on the edit screen below the status bar. It is intended to be used for site-specific quick help information.

---++ Known problems
---+++ Can't *undo* all functions (Kupu + browser)
Due to limitations in the browser support for editing, not all functions can be undone. Also, the undo buffer can be cleared unexpectedly during editing, especially when using Internet Explorer.

Because of limitations in the browsers, the editor does not support PRE blocks. All PRE blocks will be converted to TWiki verbatim blocks on save. This can cause some confusion, especially when editor formatting controls (such as "bold") have been used to format text in a PRE block. Users are advised to use only plain text in PRE (verbatim) blocks.

---+++ No Safari support
Kupu does not work on Safari.

---++ Contrib Info

This contrib is heavily based on the TWiki::Plugins.KupuEditorAddOn, and the authors of that add-on are therefore also credited as authors of this plugin.

Kupu manages to get away with this because it passes the DOM through the XML validator, which I had to disable because it strips comments. So, for now, the IE implementation will strip comments - but at least you can save again |

|  8276 | <a rel='nofollow' href='http://develop.twiki.org/~develop/cgi-bin/view/Bugs/Item1215'>Item1215</a>  added WYSIWYG_ICONS and WYSIWYG_TAGS to support user customisation of icon images and twiki variables that can be inserted |

This will only be editable by switching to source view, but hey, it's supposed to be WYSIWYG. Note that this also means that comments in pasted HTML should be retained now |

So added them to the filter whitelist, and it works again. |
|  7873 | <a rel='nofollow' href='http://develop.twiki.org/~develop/cgi-bin/view/Bugs/Item1189'>Item1189</a>  added pre save filter to try and find where the attributes are disappearing to in FF |
