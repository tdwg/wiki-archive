%TOC%

---++ StaticMethod *singularForm* <tt>($web,$pluralForm) -> $singularForm</tt>

Try to singularise plural topic name.
   * =$web= - the web the topic must be in
   * =$pluralForm= - topic name
Returns undef if no singular form exists, otherwise returns the
singular form of the topic

I18N - Only apply plural processing if site language is English, or
if a built-in English-language web (Main, TWiki or Plugins).  Plurals
apply to names ending in 's', where topic doesn't exist with plural
name.

SMELL: this is highly langauge specific, and shoud be overridable
on a per-installation basis.
