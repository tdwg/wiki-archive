# Example httpd.conf file for TWiki.
#
# You are recommended to take a copy of this file and edit
# the paths to match your installation. Then add:
# include "/home/httpd/twiki/twiki_httpd.conf"
# to the end of your main httpd.conf file.
#

# The first parameter will be part of the URL to your installation e.g.
# http://my.co.uk/twiki/bin/view/...
# The second parameter must point to the physical path on your disk. Be
# careful not to lose any trailing /'s.

#### Change the _second_ path to match your local installation
ScriptAlias /twiki/bin/ "/home/httpd/twiki/bin/"

# This defines a url that points to the root of the twiki installation. It is
# used to access files in the pub directory (attachments etc)
# It must come _after_ the ScriptAlias.

#### Change the path to match your local installation
Alias /twiki/ "/home/httpd/twiki/"


# We set an environment variable called anonymous_spider
# Setting a BrowserMatchNoCase to ^$ is important. It prevents TWiki from
# including its own topics as URLs and also prevents other TWikis from
# doing the same. This is important to prevent the most obvious
# Denial of Service attacks.
# You can expand this by adding more BrowserMatchNoCase statements to
# block evil browser agents trying the impossible task of mirroring a twiki
# Example:
# BrowserMatchNoCase ^SiteSucker anonymous_spider
BrowserMatchNoCase ^$ anonymous_spider


# This specifies the options on the TWiki scripts directory. The ExecCGI
# and SetHandler tell apache that it contains scripts. "Allow from all"
# lets any IP address access this URL.

# so if you want to control access to files attached to topics, you may
# need to add your own .htaccess files to subdirectories of pub. See the
# Apache documentation on .htaccess for more info.
